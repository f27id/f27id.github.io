# Notes - Problem Space 

Supplementary notes to complement the lecture material for Introduction to Interaction Design (F27ID) - **Problem Space**.

# Understanding the problem space
Problem space - Understand and conceptualize what is currently the user experience/product and how this is going to be improved or changed.

Different people have different perspectives, defining a problem space is usually best done by a group of different individuals.

You need to consider:
* Are there problems with an existing product or user experience?
* Why do you think there are problems?
* How do you think your proposed design ideas might overcome these?
* If you have not identified any problems  and instead are designing for a new user experience how do you think your proposed design ideas support, change, or extend current ways of doing things?
