## **What** is Task Analysis?

<aside class='notes'>
We'll start off by asking the important question [pause]
What is task analysis?
</aside>
 
</textarea>
</section>


 
<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>

### **Task analysis** is 
  * the process of learning about **users** by **observing** them in **action** 
  * **understand** how users **perform** their tasks and achieve their intended goals

  
Essentially, methods to analyse people's jobs:
  * what **people** do
  * what things they **work with**
  * what they must **know**

<aside class='notes'>
Task analysis is basically a process that a team goes through to determine your most crucial user goals in the app (for example, purchases, social shares, adding bookmarks, etc.) and the number of steps (or tasks) that a user must complete to get to the objective.
[pause]
In a nutshell, task analysis is a method of breaking a piece of work down into smaller elements and examining the relationships between the elements
</aside>

</section>
 

 
 
<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
#### **Example**: In order to clean the house
  * get the vacuum cleaner out
  * fix the appropriate attachments
  * clean the rooms
  * when the dust bag gets full, empty it
  * put the vacuum cleaner and tools away <br><br>

#### To accomplish the tasks, you must know about:
  vacuum cleaners, their attachments, dust bags, cupboards, rooms etc.
<aside class='notes'>
To help you relate to the concept of task analysis look at the following example.
[pause]
The task of cleaning a house.
[pause]
Before you even begin the task you break the solution down into steps.
</aside>

<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
## Approaches to task analysis
* **Task decomposition**
  - splitting task into (ordered) subtasks
* **Knowledge** based techniques
  - what the user knows about the task and how it is organised
* **Entity or object** based analysis
  - relationships between objects, actions and the people who perform them
* lots of different notations/techniques

<aside class='notes'>
There are different approaches to task analysis [pause]
For example [pause]
    Task decomposition:  tasks are broken into subtasks and the order in which they are performed is taken into account.
	[pause]
    Knowledge-based techniques: looks at what users need to know about objects and actions in a task and how knowledge is organized.
	[pause]
    Entity-relation based analysis: in this objects and actors are identified, relationships between them and the actions they perform.

## General Method
* **Observe** and understand the task
* **Collect** unstructured lists of words and actions
* **Organize** using notation or diagrams

<aside class='notes'>
As a general method when you begin the process of task analysis you should.
Firstly, observe the task.
Secondly, collect an unstructured list of the steps or actions.
And finally, organize the notion into a set of structured stages (using either notation or a diagram).

### Differences from other techniques

<img src='./images/taskvs.png' />

<aside class='notes'>
You can see the the table which shows a comparison between task analysis and other techniques.

<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
## Aim of **Task Decomposition**

* Describe the actions people do 
* Structure them within a task subtask hierarchy 
* Describe order of subtasks

---

Variants:
* **Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA)** most common 
* Concur Task Trees CTT (CNUCE, Pisa) uses LOTOS temporal operators

<aside class='notes'>
The aim of task decomposition is to describe the actions people do in a structured way [pause]
Variants of this include Hierarchical Task Analysis and Concur Task Trees.

## Textual HTA description

<img src='./images/taskv2.png' />

<small>Correction:Plan 0 do 1-4, when the dust bag gets full do 5.</small>

<aside class='notes'>
And example of a hierarchical Task Analysis using textual description for cleaning a house [pause].
As you can see from the steops, this provides an understanding of the tasks users need to perform to achieve certain goals.
[pause]
</aside>
 
</textarea>
</section>




<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
## Generating the Hierarchy

* 1 **get** list of tasks
* 2 **group** tasks into higher level tasks
* 3 decompose lowest **level** tasks further

---

Stopping rules
 * How do we know when to stop?
 * Is “empty the dust bag” simple enough?
 * Purpose: expand only relevant tasks
 * Motor actions: lowest sensible level

<aside class='notes'>
To help you get started generating hierarchies a good rule of thumb is to follow these three steps [pause]
Firstly, get a list of tasks [pause]
Secondly group the tasks into higher level tasks [pause]
Finally continue to decompose the lowest level tasks [pause]

To help you know when you've finished [pause]
You should use judgment calls, such as, is the process simple enough [pause]
Are the tasks logical and in a sensible order (from high to low).

## Tasks as **Explanations**

* Imagine asking the user the question:

**What are you doing now?**

* For the same action the answer may be:
  * typing ctrl-B
  * making a word bold
  * emphasising a word
  * editing a document
  * writing a letter
  * preparing a legal case

### Refining the Description

Given initial HTA (textual or diagram)

**How to check / improve it?**

---

Some heuristics:
* paired actions
  - e.g., where is `turn on gas'
* restructure
  - e.g., generate task `make pot'
* balance
  - e.g., is `pour tea' simpler than making pot?
* generalise
  - e.g., make one cup ….. or more

<aside class='notes'>
Given the initial task analysis there are methods for refining and improving the process.
[pause]
For example [pause]
using paired actions.
restructuring.
balancing.
generalization.
