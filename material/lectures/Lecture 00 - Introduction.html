						* **Read** around subject  
						* Various online **articles**
						* Review slides and revision material 
						* Number of recommended texts  
						* **Rapidly changing topic**
<aside class='notes'>
Don't just read (or listen) to the slides.
Be an active learner.
Read the recommended articles.
Work through the practice exercises. 
Get into the good habit of looking up information.
[pause]
The topic of interactive design is rapidly changing. You also need to adapt and change.
As technologies, tools and resources change, you need to be able to adapt and retrain yourself .
That is, you should be an active learner.
