<aside class='notes'>
Hello again!
 How is everyone. Today we are going to cover literature review.
 In today's lecture we will discuss, What is a literature review.
We will begin by explaining why a literature review is so important, that is, what's the motivation for a literature review.
We will then go through the structure of a literature review with details on benchmarking and statements.
Finally, we will discuss the conclusion and references section.
I will also share the Sig Kai template with you. You will need this for your course work.

## **What** is a Literature Review?    
<aside class='notes'>
Let's begin by asking, what you think a literature review is?
Some of you will seen or read literature reviews before, but what 
exactly is a literature review?

## **What** is a Literature Review?   
  * **Literature Review = Existing Knowledge** 
    -  "an account of what has been published on a topic by accredited scholars and researchers" 
  * What relevant data is **already out there**? (literature & designs) 
  * Where are the gaps and opportunities?
  * Literature Reviews are often **highly cited** as they provide details on the **research landscape**

 
<aside class='notes'>
A literature review is a survey of scholarly sources on a specific topic. For example, you can conduct literature review on usability of mobile apps.
It provides an overview of the current knowledge, allowing you to identify relevant theories, methods, and gaps in the existing research.

#### A Literature Review  
## Helps to find out: 
  * What might have **changed** since previous research was done 
  * What do we **already know**? What are the contradictions? What do we still not know?   Is the existing research flawed? What have they missed? 
  * Literature review can provide new knowledge
  * Present **trends**, analysis   
 
<aside class='notes'>
 Why literature review.
 It helps to find out what might have changed since previous research was done. 
 In simple words, we read previous research work published in research articles to understand what was done and what we already know. What are the contradictions. What are the gaps or in other words, what do we still not know.
 Is the existing research flawed? What have they missed?
 The literature rview can provide new knowledge about present trends and anlaysis.

## Literature Review from **HCI** perspective   
  * Focus on **themes**, articles which describe the problem, general ideas    - you will not find articles that discuss your exact solution!
  * Articles will support your idea and state **why**    the problem you are trying to solve is    important hence the choice of keywords is    **very critical**! 
  * Articles can be: Technical, Theoretical, Empirical,    Philosophical/Opinionated.
  * Which one(s) do you choose? And When?   
 
<aside class='notes'>
 Literature review from H C I perspective.
 Writing a literature review involves finding relevant publications such as books and journal articles, critically analyzing them, and explaining what you found. 
 The first step of literature review is search for relevant literature in books and journal articles.
 Before you begin searching for literature, you need a clearly defined topic. Our topic is related with H C I or Human Computer Interaction.
 you will focus on themes, articles which describe the problem, general ideas. Please note that it is unlikely to find articles that discuss your exact solution.
 The Articles you find can be Technical, Theoretical, Empirical, and Philosophical or Opinionated.
 You will assess and identify the relevant and authentic articles. You decide which ones are relevant, important and authentic.

## Search For
  * Articles that **describe the problem** you are trying to solve/resolve    (theoretically or present data)
  * Articles that **present solutions** to the problem you are trying to    solve/resolve
  * **Compare and Contrast** (find differences and flaws)
  * Articles that discuss contexts and solutions similar to your chosen one (in the same domain)
  * **Convince** the reader the problem you are trying to solve is important and    worthy!   
 
<aside class='notes'>
 The five steps of literature review includes Search for relevant literature, Evaluate sources, Identify themes, debates and gaps, Outline the structure and finally Write your literature review.
 The step in the process is search for articles. You search for articles that describe the problem you are trying to solve or resolve theoretically or present data.
You search for  Articles that present solutions to the problem you are trying to  solve or resolve.
You search for articles, Compare and Contrast and find differences and flaws.
You search for articles that discuss contexts and solutions similar to your chosen one in the same domain or area.
You try to convince the reader the problem you are trying to solve is important and  worthy!   
Use your keywords to begin searching for sources. Some useful databases to search for journals and articles include:
The university’s library catalogue.
Google Scholar.
Microsoft Academic.
There are plenty of other sources but we currently focus on these for this course.

### For example (**hypothetical**) - note the    transition in the articles   
  * I would like to create an app to teach maths to    preschoolers using games based learning
  * Article 1 and 2: The **importance of technology** in    education and how children find maths unengaging to    learn using conventional means
  * Article 3: Using games for **serious applications** (not    entertainment)
  * Article 4: Games used to motivate **STEM learning** in    primary school
  * Article 5: A system was devised that taught numeracy    to **small children** (look for flaws and key learning    points)   
 
<aside class='notes'>
 Lets take a look at an example. Check the slides and see how the 5 articles are being reviewed. Note the transition in the articles.
 The topic is. I would like to create an app to teach maths to preschoolers using games based learning.
 The first two articles that we searched and found discussed and concluded. The importance of technology in education and how children find maths unengaging to learn using conventional means.
 Article three states, Using games for Serious applications and not entertainment.
 Article 4 states that Games used to motivate STEM learning in primary school.
 Article 5 states that A system was devised that taught numeracy  to small children. Note, you also look for flaws and key learning points.

## Literature Review (**Cont**)  
  * You apply the principles of **analysis in your field** in    order to **evaluate** whether previous research is    **valid**; you determine if a previous **study** is    incomplete, methodologically flawed, one-sided, or    **biased**. 
    - This means that you do **not simply list**    previous studies but that you assess them, noting    their strengths and weaknesses. 
  * Through the Literature Review you **distinguish** what    has been done from what **needs** to be done 

 
<aside class='notes'>
 We continue literature review.
 You apply the principles of analysis in your field in  order to evaluate whether previous research is valid.
 You determine if a previous study is incomplete, methodologically flawed, one-sided, or biased. 
 This means that you do not simply list previous studies but that you assess them, noting their strengths and weaknesses. 
 Through the Literature Review you distinguish what has been done from what needs to be done.

## Referencing   /Citation

### The **Purpose** of **Referencing**

  * **Acknowledging** the research/words/ideas of others 
  * **Demonstrating** you have read widely 
  * Providing **evidence** for backing up your claims/ viewpoint 
  * There are many different ways of citing resources from research.
  * The citation style sometimes depends on the academic discipline involved. The **Harvard System** (aka Author-Date) is our School's preferred style   
 
<aside class='notes'>
 Referencing and Citations are an important part of the literature review.
 The citation and referencing is a way of giving credit to individuals for their creative and intellectual works that you utilized to support your research. It acknowledges the research work and ideas of others.
 It demonstrates that you have researched and read work by other researchers.
 You provide evidence to backup your claims or viewpoint. 
 There are many different ways of citing resources from research for example A P A , Vancourver, I triple E, and Harvard. 
 The citation style sometimes depends on the academic discipline involved. Our school's preferred style is Harvard.

## **Examples** of Harvard Style   

  * Information about any one source must always appear in **two places**: 
    1. In-text (part of a sentence)
    2. In the reference list (at the end)
  * The **in-text** reference (Author's Surname Year, page) must    **match exactly** the full reference in the **reference section**: 
    - An in-text a reference looks like this: Action Research is 'reflective research practice' (Cherry    1999, p. 17)
  * The reader then looks for 'Cherry 1999' in the reference list    where it looks like this: 
    - Cherry, N 1999, Action Research: A Pathway to Action,    Knowledge and Learning, RMIT University Press, Melbourne. 
 
<aside class='notes'>
 Let's have a look at some examples of Harvard style of citation.
 To reference work from other researchers in your work, information about any one source must always appear in two places.
 First, it should appear in the text (part of sentence) and second, it should appear in the reference list.
 You can see examples of Harvard Style on the slide.
 The in text citation should have Author's name, year of publication and page number if needed. It must match the full reference in the reference list.
 For example, see point number 5 on the slide. Action research is reflective research practice and look the reference starts with bracket author name, year of publication and page number. ( Cherry 1999, page 17)
 You can see the reference for this should appear in the reference list as shown in the bottom of the slide.

## **Why** Harvard style?
  * Every institution, conference,  venue has its format
  * Will I have to manually edit my    references every time? 
    - Yes, but it is too time consuming.
  * We recommend you to use "EndNote" software

<aside class='notes'>
 Now lets discuss the reason for using Harvard style.
 The citation style sometimes depends on the academic discipline involved. Researchers from different disciplines prefer different citation styles.
 Harvard is our school's preferred citation style.
 The key questions is, how do I create and edit the references.
 You can do it manually in MS word, but it is too time consuming.
 We recommend to use EndNote software for referecing.

 How do we find and retrieve literature. 
 We discussed earlier, that searching articles is an important part of the literature review.
 Here, we will discuss, how to find and retrieve literature.
 It is important to search using relevant keywords

<aside class='notes'>
 Using Google scholar.
 It is important to use relevant and specific keywords. You can use google scholar standard search to find most of the relevant articles.
 You can also use Advanced search filters to narrow down your search. For example if you search for robots, you will a number of articles related to robot research in your search results.

## What is a **credible** source? 
  * **Authority**: what are the authors credentials? What type of site? 
    - Is the content **peer reviewed**? 
  * **Accuracy**: are the facts verifiable? References included? 
  * **Objectivity**: is it fact, opinion or propaganda? is it up-to-date? Is the date indicated?
  * Who else cites the work? How many times?
  * Wikipedia is **not authentic**, neither are blogs, or youtube links
 
 
<aside class='notes'>
 At this point you now how to perform search using different sources including Google scholar, Microsoft academic. 
 Now when you have the research results, how do you filter through the good and relevant articles. There are a number of parameters to consider.
 First you check the Authority. what are the authors credentials? What type of site? Is the content of article peer reviewed? 
 Second, you check Accuracy. are the facts verifiable. Are the facts justified with sufficient References. 
 Third is Objectivity. Does the article state facts, opinion or propaganda. Is the work up-to-date. Is the date of research and publication indicated.
 Fourth and important is, how many other researchers have cited the work.The higher the number of citations, the better. For example if an article is cited by 1000 researchers, it means, the work is important.
 Remember that Wikipedia is not an authentic, neither are blogs, or youtube links.

## How can I find/retrieve literature (other than    Google scholar) 
  * Publisher websites
  * **ACM, IEEE, Springer**
  * Journal catalogues
  * Subscription can be an issue
  * Go through library website
  * Go through Google scholar (tries to get the PDF)
  * At home use the **library proxy**
    - https://scholar.google.es/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_humancomputerinteraction 
 
<aside class='notes'>
 Lets discuss searching for literature sources other than Google scholar.
 There are a number of sources and some of them are discussed on earlier slides.
 The sources include Publisher websites, Journals catalogues, A C M , I triple E, Springer, Scopus etc. 
 You could go through the University's library website to access these resources for free as some of the sources are subcription based and may require access fee.
