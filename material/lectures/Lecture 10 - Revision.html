  UX vs Usability \n 
 
 <aside class='notes'>
 
Usability - ensuring that products are easy to use learn, effective to use from the users' perspective

User experience design (UX)- how a product behaves and is used by people in the real world; and how people feel about interacting with it in any way e.g. using it, opening it, looking at

Usability and User Experience - HCI emphasises Usability but the importance of User Experience is becoming recognised too and is part of Interaction Design.

# Usability Definition  \n 
  * Usability factors:
 \n -Effectiveness - how well does the product to what it is supposed to do /  \n help the user do what they are supposed to do?
 \n -Efficiency - does it require minimal effort from the user or are there  \n many extra / complex steps to a task?
 \n -Error prevention- does it protect users from their own mistakes?
 \n -Safety - does it protect the user, e.g allow remote use in a dangerous  \n situation; 
 \n -Utility - does it provide the right functionality and tools so users can do  \n what they want and need to do?
 \n -Learnability - how easy is it to learn how to use it?
 \n -Memorability  \n

# Slide6
  * [62] How to achieve Usability goals? \n 
  * [34] Some widely agreed design principles for usability
 \n Affordance - objects should have attributes that allow people to know  \n how to use them 
 \n Feedback - people should know what they did
 \n Visibility - the more visible the controls are, the easier to use 
 \n Constraints - only offer those functions that are useful in context 
 \n Consistency - does the same thing in the same way, same images mean  \n the same thing
 \n Non-Destructive Operations - importance of undo
 \n Scalability - operations should work on all screen sizes, small and large
 \n Reliability - operations should work, always \n 
  * [16] 6 \n 
 
 <aside class='notes'>
 Affordance: to give a clue. Button invites pushing, real and virtual affordances.
Feedback: imagine writing without seeing the ink
Visibility: the more visible the more likely they know what to do next. Phone mailbox. Alexa.
Constraints: Guide the user to what they are allowed to do
Consistency: Ctrl+A. Ctrl+Shift+S does not work in all programmes on the Mac.

Trying to achieve one might destroy the other, constraint vs visibiltiy. Knife example for consistency to show that it works without as well.

These Usability principles are very general and can be applied to the design of most interactive systems and devices. But even so, they are not absolute and they involve trade-offs. For certain applications, devices or designs there may be a higher priority for some of these principles than others. For example the scalability design principle wont apply to a system that will only ever be used on a single kind of screen.

# Slide7
  * [62] User Experience Threads \n 
  * [44] Sensual Thread: Sensory engagement and level  \n of absorption
 \n Emotional Thread: How do you feel about the  \n product?
 \n Compositional Thread: The narrative of the  \n experience
 \n Spatio-temporal Thread: Space and time of the  \n experience and the influence on it \n 
  * [16] 7 \n 
 
 <aside class='notes'>
 McCarthy and Write propose four threads that make up our holistic experience.
Sensual thread: absorbed by games, phones, and chatrooms
Emotional thread: judgment of product, buy the cool phone. Get angry because the PC doesn't work.
Compositional thread: What is this about? Where am I? What has happened? What is going to happen? What would happen if .?
Spatio-temporal thread: time speeding up or standing still. Need my own space, personal or public space.

# Slide8
  * [62] User Experience Goals \n 
  * [38] Aim for experiences which are
 \n Satisfying, aesthetically pleasing, enjoyable, engaging,  \n pleasurable, exciting, supportive of creativity, entertaining,  \n helpful, motivating, challenging, surprising.
 \n And avoid
 \n Boring, frustrating, making one feel guilty, annoying, childish,  \n unpleasant, patronising, making one feel stupid, gimmicky..
 \n Levels of response to a product (Norman)
 \n Visceral - how it feels physically or emotionally 
 \n Behavioural - functional, what can we do with it
 \n Reflective - e.g. does it reflect our personal or cultural values \n 
  * [16] 8 \n 
 
 <aside class='notes'>
 Everything has UX, ketchup, newspaper, etc. all aspects of the users interaction with product and company.
Cannot design UX but only for UX. Phone case example.
Cultural values, US date, different images for IKEA chatbot

User Experience goals are mostly subjective qualities, how people feel about the product. It is harder to measure and quantify whether a design meets its User Experience goals (methods will be covered elsewhere in the course and in Experimental Design ) User Experience design goals may be positive or negative - a design should aim for the positive ones and avoid the negative

 \n Memory - recall and filtering
 \n Learning
 \n Language processing - reading, speaking and listening
 \n Problem-solving, planning, reasoning, and decision making
 \n Mental models

  * [62] Mental v. Conceptual models \n 
  * [44] Conceptual models (e.g. the  \n desktop) help users learn/recall  \n how to operate a system - can  \n assist understanding of what it can  \n do
 \n Mental model describes how the  \n user understands how the  \n underlying system actually works  \n and what it can do \n

# Slide12
  * [62] Functional vs non-functional \n 
  * [28.42] Functional Requirements (F)
 \n Services/function provided
 \n 'What' NOT 'How'
 \n e.g. "The user must be able to stop the robot"
 \n "The robot must be able to climb stairs"
 \n "The form field must take a date"
 \n 
 \n 
 \n 
 \n Non-Functional Requirements (NF)
 \n Constraints such as running on certain platforms, conforming to standards...
 \n Attributes such as appearance, usability
 \n 'Quality Attributes'
 \n e.g. "the system must be scalable"
 \n "the system must run on all platforms"

  * [62] What is a prototype? \n 
  * [44] In interaction design, a prototype is a limited  \n representation of the design for a device you are  \n trying to build, that allows users to interact with  \n the device and explore the suitability of the design \n

  * [62] Low fidelity prototypes  \n 
  * [40] Uses a medium which is unlike the final medium, e.g.  \n paper, cardboard
 \n Is quick, cheap, and easily changed
 \n Examples:
 \n Sketches of screens, task sequences
 \n Cards or 'Post-it' notes
 \n Storyboards
 \n 'Wizard-of-Oz'
 \n Phone on a watchstrap (early smartwatch prototype) \n

  * [62] Low-fidelity prototypes \n 
  * [40] Cheap to build
 \n Easy to evaluate multiple concepts
 \n Identify market requirements
 \n Good for proof-of-concept and communication
 \n But:
 \n No error checking
 \n Limited as a specification
 \n Not much use after requirements are established
 \n Limited navigation and flow
 \n Look-and-feel different from the end product \n

  * [62] High-fidelity prototypes \n 
  * [37.62] Complete functionality (for at least part of the system)
 \n Fully interactive
 \n User driven
 \n Clear navigation, final look-and-feel 
 \n Useful for testing and exploring
 \n Part of specification for final product
 \n Marketing and sales
 \n But
 \n Expensive and time consuming to build
 \n Inefficient for proof-of-concept
 \n Less effective for requirements \n

# Slide18
  * [62] Compromises in prototypes \n 
  * [37.24] We can't prototype everything about an interface
 \n All prototypes involve compromises
 \n For software-based prototyping maybe there is a slow  \n response? Sketchy icons? Limited functionality? 
 \n Two common types of compromise
 \n 'horizontal': Provide a wide range of functions, but with little  \n detail
 \n 'vertical': Provide a lot of detail for only a few functions
 \n The compromises in our prototypes mustn't be ignored  \n or forgotten. The prototype isn't the full product which  \n will still need engineering.  \n

# Slide19
  * [46] Evaluation: Method Selection \n 
  * [28] The evaluation approach influences the methods used, and in turn, how data is  \n collected, analyzed and presented.
 \n E.g., field studies typically:
 \n Involve observation and interviews.
 \n Do not involve controlled tests in a laboratory.
 \n Produce qualitative data.
 \n 
 \n E.g., Usability testing typically:
 \n Involves users, interviews, design, questionnaires.
 \n Conducted in the laboratory or in a natural setting.
 \n Primary goal is to test how usable the interface is with intended populations. \n
