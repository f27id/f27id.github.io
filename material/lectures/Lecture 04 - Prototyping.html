What is a prototype?

<section data-markdown>

## What is a prototype?    
  * In other design fields a prototype is often a    small-scale model
  * For example:
    - a miniature car
	- a miniature building or town   
  
 
<aside class='notes'>
The definition of a prototype is a first or preliminary version of a concept from which other forms are developed.

## What is a prototype?
 
  * In **interaction design**, a prototype is a limited    **representation of the design** for a device you are    trying to build
  * Allows users to interact with    the device and explore the suitability of the    design   

 
<aside class='notes'>
Hence, a prototype in the context of interaction design is a representation of the design for evaluating and testing the suitability [pause]
As the prototype provides a version of the design that users can interact to gather information.
</aside>
 
</textarea>
</section>
 
 
 
<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
## What is a prototype?   
  * In interaction design it **can be** (among other things):
     - a set of cards
     - a storyboard, i.e. a cartoon-like series of scenes 
     - a slide show
     - a video simulating the use of a system
     - a lump of wood (e.g. PalmPilot)
     - a cardboard mock-up
     - a piece of hardware with limited functionality
     - a piece of software with limited functionality
  * A model made of Plasticene, beads, string, **Lego** ...   
  
<aside class='notes'>
Don't think a prototype is simply a build of the concept [pause]
It can also be represented in a variety of forms [pause]
For example, a set of cards or a physical model carved out of wood [pause]
The different prototypes can be used to evaluate different aspects of the design. (like the usability or physical feel).

## Low/High Fidelity Prototypes

<aside class='notes'>
Let's move onto low and high fidelity prototypes. 
</aside>
</textarea>
</section>
 
<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
## **Low** fidelity prototypes    
  * Uses a medium which is **unlike the final medium**,    e.g. paper, cardboard
  * Is **quick, cheap, and easily** changed
  * Examples:
    * Sketches of screens, task sequences
    * Cards or **'Post-it'** notes
    * Storyboards
    * 'Wizard-of-Oz'
    * Phone on a watchstrap (early smartwatch prototype)   

 
<aside class='notes'>
Firstly, low fidelity prototypes [pause]
You could see these as cheap, quick and easy to create and change prototypes [pause]
Examples of these, include.
paper models.

Storyboards.

## Example of low fidelity prototype

  * Made from  paper and magnets 
   - (a) top attached to the side
   - (b) top hinged open
   - (c) top detached from the base.

## **How** to prototype?   
  * **Sketching** is important to low-fidelity    prototyping
  * Don't be inhibited about drawing ability.    Practice simple symbols
  * Example: a quick storyboard that depicts how    to fill a car with petrol

# Storyboards   

 * A series of **sketches** showing how a user might    progress through a task using the device 
 * Used **early in design**
 * Often used with scenarios, bringing more detail,    and a chance to role play   

 
<aside class='notes'>
Now we'll move onto storyboards. [pause]
A storyboard is a graphic organizer that consists of illustrations or images displayed in sequence for the purpose of pre-visualising a motion picture, animation, motion graphic or interactive media sequence

# Card-based prototypes    
  * Index **cards** (3 x 5 inches)

## What can go wrong with Wizard-of-Oz?   
  * Humans can do more than computers so they    may build **unrealistic expectations**
  * Human wizards may find it hard to limit    themselves to a feasible computer's response   
  
<aside class='notes'>

For example, the interaction mechanisms can be difficult to model or provide unrealistic expectations

## Summary of Low-fidelity prototypes   
  * Cheap to build
  * Easy to evaluate multiple concepts
  * Identify market requirements
  * Good for proof-of-concept and communication
  * But:
    - No error checking
    - Limited as a specification
    - Not much use after requirements are established
    - Limited navigation and flow
    - Look-and-feel different from the end product   

 
<aside class='notes'>
To summarize low-fidelity prototypes before we move onto high-fidelty [pause]
We have listed the pros and cons. [pause]
Crucially, low-fidelity prototypes usually come first and are a quick, cheap and easy way to evaluate a concept.
[pause]
But remember, low-fidelty prototypes have [pause]
no error checking, 
limited features,
and have low-quality look and feel.

# **High**-fidelity prototypes

<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
## High-fidelity prototypes   
  * **Complete functionality** (for at least part of the system)
  * Fully interactive
  * User driven
  * Clear navigation, **final** look-and-feel 
  * Useful for **testing and exploring**
  * Part of specification for final product
  * Marketing and sales
  * But
  * **Expensive** and time consuming to build
  * Inefficient for proof-of-concept
  * Less effective for requirements   

 
<aside class='notes'>
high-fidelity prototypes are highly functional and interactive. They are very close to the final product, with most of the necessary design assets and components developed and integrated. Hi-fi prototypes are often used in the later stages to test usability and identify issues in the workflow.

## **Example** of high-fidelity prototype   
  Doppio double-screen smartwatch (Seyed et al, CHI 2016)   
  * Doppio double-screen smartwatch
  * Made from two Sony smartwatches
  * Provided **all basic operations and some apps**
  * Weather app
  * Photosharing app
  * Still a bit clunky   

 
<aside class='notes'>

</aside>
 
</textarea>
</section>
 
 
<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
## What to do with your prototype?
  * Discuss with other **designers**
  * Show to managers and customers
  * Show to users and get **feedback**
  * Interviews, focus groups
  * Try it out **"for real"**, let users try it, get    feedback
  * Try **experiments**
  * Try tasks
  * In the lab or "in the wild"   

 
<aside class='notes'>
In addition to using your prototype for testing and evaluating the quality of your design, 
it also provides a resource for sharing and discussing concepts with other designers. 
[pause]
For management to see the product or help develop promotional material
[pause]
Of course, at the end of the day, the prototype is for getting REAL feedback.

## "In the wild" Google Glass   
  * User **experience** experiment
  * Not a statistical experiment! But still valuable.
  * "Explorers" took the glasses home, wore them when and    how they liked - "in the wild", not in a lab
  * Did the glasses work? How did wearers react? What did    they do with them?
  * Expect to discover the unexpected
  * Big question turned out to be: How did other people    react?
  * Experiment had a big effect on the design of VR/AR    glasses (HoloLens)
  * Were Google Glasses prototypes?

## Compromises in prototypes   
  * We **can't prototype everything** about an interface
  * All prototypes involve compromises
  * For software-based prototyping maybe there is a slow    response? Sketchy icons? Limited functionality? 
  * Two common types of compromise
    * **'horizontal'**: Provide a wide range of **functions**, but with little    detail
    * **'vertical'**: Provide a lot of **detail** for only a few functions
  * The **compromises** in our prototypes mustn't be ignored    or forgotten. The prototype isn't the full product which    will still need engineering.    
 
<aside class='notes'>
Prototpying is important [pause]
However, you can't prototype everything. [pause]
Always a compromise [pause]

## Construction   
  Taking the prototypes (or **learning** from them)
  * **Quality** must be attended to: usability (our    focus!) and also reliability, robustness,    maintainability, integrity, portability,    efficiency, etc
  * The product must be engineered
  * Evolutionary prototyping vs **'Throw-away'**    prototyping   
 
<aside class='notes'>
Some prototypes may be used repeatedly during the evolution process of a product versus quick and dirty prototypes
[pause]
Ultimately the prototypes help designers learn and develop the final product.
