# What is    interaction    design?   
 
<aside class='notes'>
 Now when you're asking yourself what interaction design is, hopefully you know that the design part of this term only means you are designing the interaction part.

  * Interaction == Communication (two ways)
  * Actions & Feedback
    * Abundance of theory/research/articles on topic
	* Wider Context of the Subject
 
<aside class='notes'>
 And interaction may best be seen as a two-way communication between a user and a product.
We're talking about every action that a user performs, that may or may not evoke a response from the product
And you as the creator of the product can guide those actions! 
Example in a web shop may be auto-selecting the Medium size of a product, to decrease the chances of people going for small.

Some theory helps you think/understand elements of IxD

e.g. feedback in games to **enhance narrative**

  <img src='.\images\lec09Slide6-2.png' 
 style = '

   width:410.9595px;
   height:auto;

   height:auto;

<aside class='notes'>
And there is definitely useful theory out there that helps you talk about interaction design. 
An example is the design of Head Up Displays for games, where the interface designer has to make conscious decisions on adding or removing content from the narrative.

Some theory helps you think/understand elements of IxD

e.g. **affording & constraining actions** through design

And in all types of products, physical, virtual, mixed reality, a designer has to come up with what a user may or may not do. These constraints and affordances can differentiate your products from others, like this amazing chair...

* Interaction design is about "Designing interactive products to **support the way people** communicate    and interact in their everyday and    working lives"
  * Sharp, Rogers, and Preece (2007)
  
* **No** design is **perfect**  under all   circumstances

<aside class='notes'>
So interaction design is about creating a plan for that communication, which will always become some sort of compromise. You may for example focus too much on functionality rather than ease-of-use.

#### Recap: Interaction Design   
  * **Communicate**, amongst others (and most importantly):
  * Providing information to a user, visualising functionality 
	- Showing what a user can do
    - Effectively, Efficiently, Consistently 
  * Provide feedback, tangible/discernible consequence of an interaction
  * Allowing **certain types of interaction** (affordance), while restricting others    (constraints)  
 
<aside class='notes'>
 That means the final compromise you want to be making, should do well on the things you find important for your product. But there are definitely some minimal requirements. 

For example the product should help a user achieve whatever predefined goal effectively, efficiently and consistently. There should be some form of feedback and appropriate constraints and affordances.

### Recap: Usability is **Quantifiable**   
  * Effective use of product 
  * Safe use of product   
  * Good functionality   
  * Learnability, Remember-ability
  <hr>
  
   Q. Does the product do what it is supposed to do?<br>
   Q. Is the user supported in performing tasks? How fast, mistakes?<br>
   Q. Does the product protect the user from possible danger?<br>
   Q. Does the product provide the desired function, how well?<br>
   Q. Is it easy to learn how to use the product?<br>
   Q. Will the user remember how to use the product, e.g. even when the product is only used once every  year? <br>  

 
<aside class='notes'>
 And the most important aspects of usable design are listed here. Good idea to answer these and similar questions critically when designing any product users will interact with.

## Recap: User Experience

<aside class='notes'>
 Besides usability, other factors like usefulness determine the user's experience. University websites for example are often regarded useless, even though the site may be very usable.
Useful: Your content should be original and fulfils a need
Usable: Site must be easy to use
Desirable: Image, identity, brand, and other design elements are used to evoke emotion and appreciation
Findable: Content needs to be navigable and locatable onsite and offsite
Accessible: Content needs to be accessible to people with disabilities
Credible: Users must trust and believe what you tell them

#### Recap 1: User eXperience (UX), Hard to Quantify   

  * Literally what a user experiences when using a product
    * more or less subjective 

  * Does the product support user in achieving a specific goal?
  * Emotions experienced during use   
	* What if you have to pay e.g. a speeding ticket?   
  * Is product **intuitive** to use?   
    - According to Spool (2005) a design is intuitive if the **user does not require new knowledge** to operate the system.

 
<aside class='notes'>
But the issue with User experience is that it literally is a measure of emotions experienced during product use. UX aspects are more or less subjective and ease-of-use is suddenly related to how easy it is to use a product without ever learning about it. Although, will a self-driving car be as intuitive to use as a stapler?

#### Recap: User eXperience (UX), hard to quantify   

### **Why** is UX hard to quantify?

  * Emotions are hard to quantify
  * Lot of factors that may influence these emotions!   
 
<aside class='notes'>
 In general emotions are hard to quantify and measure, but the biggest problem with quantifying user experience is the multitude of factors that might play a role

#### Recap: Problem space & Conceptual model   
  * **Why** are you **designing** something?
  * **Solve** a problem in an existing product; or **Solve** the problems of a 'new' product
  * How is your design solving the problem?
    * Initially high-level / abstract / global  
    * Objects: attributes, operations, relationships, metaphors     	
    * Interaction types: instructing, conversing, manipulating, exploring.
  
  * Understand the problem space to help inform a solution
  * Conceptual Model of solution(s)   

 
<aside class='notes'>
 We've talked about interactions. When we move onward to the design of interactions, it turns out they are related to the problem your product is solving. And the more you know about the problem space, the more informed and suited your solutions will become.

 These are some sketches detailing those types of interactions, knowing that the 3D model on the computer would be a voxel model. As using polygon meshes would require too much computation to even perform simple additions and removals in real-time.

#### Interfaces & Interactions   
  * Should you follow a specific **interface paradigm**?
  * e.g., Windows interface easier to learn (vs command line)
    * What part was easier to learn / understand?     	
    * When is it 'intuitive' to use a product?   	   	
      * According to Spool (2005) a design is **intuitive if the user does not require new knowledge** to operate the system.   
 
<aside class='notes'>
 This brings us to the next topic; interfaces and interactions. I'm not sure if you had a lecture on this already. But the idea is that a computer can be controlled by the command line perfectly fine.
Still, most people use a WIMP interface. That is windows. 
Why? Because it's so much easier to learn and understand.

#### affordances & constraints   
  * Affordance and Constraints Vary
    * Depend on Interface (Physical, Virtual, Mixed..., )
      * Think **beyond** buttons  
 
<aside class='notes'>
 Affordances and constraints for these different modes. Not just in the sense of which buttons you could press, but also which buttons would be shown to you.

#### What it boils down to:   
  A **suitable interface** and **accompanying interaction**
  
  depends on the envisioned end-user(s) and their goal(s).   
 
 e.g., using Siri whilst driving a motorbike on the highway   
 
<aside class='notes'>
 Importantly, what these examples show, is that the interface, and the possible interactions, can change to fit the envisioned end-users and their short-term goals.

## User Characteristics are part of the Problem Space
   
   * Cognitive abilities can **vary** - e.g. memory
     * Educational background, age, culture and nationality, age, physical abilities,    attitude to computers....
   * System use
     * Novice or expert users
     * Frequent or casual users
   * Humans vary in many dimensions!  Therefore, Personas / User Profiles   
     * **Understanding users**
 
<aside class='notes'>
 And as you can then imagine, user characteristics are part of the problem space! 
Therefore, you try to determine a scenario. A user with specific or generic cognitive abilities, educational background, expertise etc.

### Cognition

   * The **mental action or process** of acquiring knowledge and understanding   through thought, experience, and the senses.
   
   * A perception, sensation, idea, or intuition resulting from the process of   Cognition.

 Theory vs Practice
 
<aside class='notes'>
As soon as you start looking at theory you'll find there's a lot of things to think about and little practical guidelines.
</aside>
 
</textarea>
</section>
 
 
 
<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
#### The users' understanding of the interaction (practical findings)
 * Use familiar symbols and/or words for well-known functions, put them in familiar    or expected position and make the function comparable with similar functions    users have seen before.
  * Make it obvious what less well-known functions will do by using familiar things    as metaphors to demonstrate their function.
 * Increase consistency so that function, location and appearance of features are    consistent between different parts of the design and throughout each part.
   * Blackler et al. (2005)  
 
<aside class='notes'>
 And as you can see from these amazing findings, the guidelines that researchers did come up with are really straightforward and you don't really need a big experiment to come up with these ideas. Like using familiar symbols, be consistent with the location of buttons, ...

To evaluate assumptions chosen solutions to cope with the problem space.
* A user-survey may provide an initial idea, but users often have no idea of what    they want until they try it.
* A prototype can enable validation and testing, for example: 
  * usability testing for a specified target groups of users   (e.g. to determine issues, benchmark different solutions, competitor, analysis, learnability)
  
 
 
<aside class='notes'>
 So it's actually very straightforward. You prototype to evaluate your assumptions, because honestly a user survey doesn't do the trick well enough. A cheap mockup as a non-functional prototype can already help, which is really what you guys are doing in the group work. And such prototypes can help either improving a product or dropping it entirely before spending loads of money on developing something no-one wants. Likely Google glass was only created to issue patents on technology...

## Fail fast and fail cheap!
   
* Sketches, Quick story-boards, Card-based protoypes, Wizard-of-oz
* Low-fidelity prototypes vs High-fidelity prototypes    
 
<aside class='notes'>
 Failing fast and cheap. 
Can be done initially with sketches, quick storyboards, card-based prototypes, wizard of oz and more.
Then later you can continue to make low-fidelity prototypes to test specific functions, and still later you improve the functionality and detail of your prototypes

Example, workflow shows how input from the RGB camera and the infrared camera is processed and combined, only to show that the individual steps are feasible.
Top part is the 3D input from a Kinect, which is cropped to whatever happens within a predefined space. 
Bottom part tracks the user's hands, which can be overlayed with the 3D input to remove those voxels, leaving only the object you want to scan.

     * Depending on the type of project, the types of requirements may    differ 
      
 
<aside class='notes'>
 And while you might think "ooh noooo, requirements! That's the worst part of it all", every improvement upon your requirements is a milestone w.r.t. improving your design.

Loads of different types of requirements you can and should think about.

### Why are **requirements** so **important**?
 * Integrate all aspects of the product (solution), 
 * Including those aspects related to the Interaction Design:
   * Usability
   * Usefulness
   * Accessibility (Users)
   * Desirability, credibility, etc. 
   * User Experience
 
<aside class='notes'>
 It's very simple, if you overthink your requirements better (not just adding more requirements), you are more likely to successfully synthesize all of these influences to UX.

### Remember 
  * Fail fast and fail hard
  * Don't be afraid to throw away stuff
  * **Be critical**
  * Come up with a specific task for the **evaluation**
  * Step by step plan that replicates a use-case

 
<aside class='notes'>
Finally then, don't be afraid to throw away stuff!
Be critical of what you came up with
