		## Overview

		* Generic lecture on Interaction Design (IxD): 
		* Overview of IxD topics some slides heavy on text
		* Both recap and upcoming lectures 
		* Introducing the concept of design thinking   
		* And some examples of the Interaction Design stuff from myself as example   
		* Questions and Discussion
		
<aside class='notes'>
Hi everyone, today will be a general overview of interaction design. That means some slides are quite heavy on text. The slides are online as well so if I'm going too fast just tell me or keep track on your own laptop
Topics will be a recap of previous lectures as well as of some upcoming lectures, showing some examples
And the idea is that I introduce the concept of design thinking!

  * Recap 1: Introduction to IxD   
  * Interaction == Communication (two ways)
  * Actions & Feedback
 
  * Loads of theory out there       in my opinion most of it is common sense...   
 
<aside class='notes'>
 And interaction may best be seen as a two-way communication between a user and a product.
We're talking about every action that a user performs, that may or may not evoke a response from the product
And you as the creator of the product can guide those actions! 
Nudge = example in a webshop may be auto-selecting the Medium size of a product, to decrease the chances of people going for small.

* But some theory helps you think/talk about elements of IxD
  E.g. feedback in games to enhance narrative

 style = '

   width:210.9595px;

<aside class='notes'>
 And there is definitely useful theory out there that helps you talk about interaction design. An example is the design of Head Up Displays for games, where the interface designer has to make conscious decisions on adding or removing content from the narrative.

* But some theory helps you think/talk about elements of IxD
  - E.g. affording & constraining actions through design

 And in all types of products, physical, virtual, mixed reality, a designer has to come up with what a user may or may not do. These constraints and affordances can differentiate your products from others, like this amazing chair...

* Recap 1: Introduction to Interaction Design (IxD)   
* What is Interaction Design?    "Designing interactive products to   support the way people communicate    and interact in their everyday and    working lives"   -Sharp, Rogers, and Preece (2007)
  
 No design is perfect  under all   circumstances

<aside class='notes'>
 So interaction design is about creating a plan for that communication, which will always become some sort of compromise. You may for example focus too much on functionality rather than ease-of-use.

## Recap 1: Introduction to Interaction Design   
  * What is Interaction Design? 
  * Communicate, amongst others (and most importantly):
  * Providing information to a user, visualising functionality ~ showing   what a user can do
  * Effectively
  * Efficiently
  * Consistently 
  * Provide feedback, tangible/discernible consequence of an interaction
  * Allowing certain types of interaction (affordance), while restricting others    (constraints)  
 
<aside class='notes'>
 That means the final compromise you want to be making, should do well on the things you find important for your product. But there are definitely some minimal requirements. 

For example the product should help a user achieve whatever predefined goal effectively, efficiently and consistently. There should be some form of feedback and appropriate constraints and affordances.

  * Efficient use of product   
  * Safe use of product   
  * Good functionality   
  * Learnability
  * Remember-ability
  
  * Does the product do what it is supposed to do?
  * Is the user supported in performing tasks? How    fast, mistakes?
  * Does the product protect the user from possible    danger?
  * Does the product provide the desired function,    how well?
  * Is it easy to learn how to use the product?
  * Will the user remember how to use the product,    e.g. even when the product is only used once every    year?

<aside class='notes'>
 Besides usability, other factors like usefulness determine the experience of a user. University websites for example are often regarded useless, even though the site may be very usable.
Useful: Your content should be original and fulfill a need
Usable: Site must be easy to use
Desirable: Image, identity, brand, and other design elements are used to evoke emotion and appreciation
Findable: Content needs to be navigable and locatable onsite and offsite
Accessible: Content needs to be accessible to people with disabilities
Credible: Users must trust and believe what you tell them

## Recap 1: User eXperience (UX), hard to quantify   
  * Literally what a user 
  * experiences 
  * when using a product...

  * more or less subjective 

  * Does the product support me in achieving a    specific goal?
  * 
  * Emotions experienced during use   What if you have to pay e.g. a speeding ticket?   
  * Is it 'intuitive' to use this product?   According to Spool (2005) a design is intuitive if the user    does not require new knowledge to operate the system.
 
  * More.
 
 
<aside class='notes'>
 But the issue with User experience is that it literally is a measure of emotions experienced during product use. UX aspects are more or less subjective and ease-of-use is suddenly related to how easy it is to use a product without ever learning about it. Although, will a self-driving car be as intuitive to use as a stapler?

## Recap 2: Problem space & Conceptual model   
  * Why are you designing something?
  * Solve a problem in an existing product   Solve the problems of a 'new' product
  * How is your design solving the problem?
  * Initially high-level / abstract / global    	Objects: attributes, operations, relationships, metaphors     	Interaction types: instructing, conversing, manipulating, exploring.
  * Later more specific

  * Understand the problem space    to help inform a solution
  * Conceptual Model of solution(s)   

 
<aside class='notes'>
 We've talked about interactions. When we move onward to the design of interactions, it turns out they are related to the problem your product is solving. And the more you know about the problem space, the more informed and suited your solutions will become.

 As an example, for my Masters I did some research into 3D design software. The issue I was trying to solve was the steep learning curve of these software packages, that focused on functionality but are hardly any fun to use. 
So the idea was to look at making 3D design on a computer so easy that a child can use it.

 That made it very easy to come up with a conceptual solution. And just visualising your conceptual model with some shitty sketches can already help re-enforcing your idea and makes it possible to get feedback from others.

 These are some sketches detailing those types of interactions, knowing that the 3D model on the computer would be a voxel model. As using polygon meshes would require too much computation to even perform simple additions and removals in real-time.

<aside class='notes'>
 This brings us to the next topic; interfaces and interactions. I'm not sure if you had a lecture on this already. But the idea is that a computer can be controlled by the command line perfectly fine.
Still, most people use a WIMP interface. That is windows . 
Why? Because it's so much easier to learn and understand.

<aside class='notes'>
 Most, if not all, current research in interaction design is aimed at Natural User Interfaces. Or Natural Interaction. Where seemingly "intuitive" interaction modes are used to control a system. Examples are touch, speech, haptic feedback etc. Up to the point where the interface is effectively invisible.

 My solution was to visualise the change of interaction mode by changing the amount of information on the screen. Constraining the interactions you can do in the physical mode, because a user doesn't need most of the functionality at that time,...

## The users' understanding of the interaction (practical findings)
 * Use familiar symbols and/or words for well-known functions, put them in familiar    or expected position and make the function comparable with similar functions    users have seen before.
  * Make it obvious what less well-known functions will do by using familiar things    as metaphors to demonstrate their function.
 * Increase consistency so that function, location and appearance of features are    consistent between different parts of the design and throughout each part.
 * Blackler et al. (2005)

* The users' understanding of the interaction (practical findings)      Appearance of buttons, like shape, size, colour and labelling, is the most important    factor with respect to interaction speed and how intuitive the interface is thought to    be. Whereas location can decrease the response times, but only marginally    influences the intuitiveness of the interface.
   Familiarity with technology is more indicative of performance than level of expertise    with a certain type of product.   	Younger people generally are more familiar with interfaces, and use them more intuitively. Aging    	effects, adaptability to new technology and overall familiarity with 'modern' types of interfaces   	play a role.   									   					Blackler et al. (2011)

 And non-surprisingly the appearance of a button is important for the 'intuitiveness' of an interface, even more so than the location.

  ## Why? 
   To evaluate assumptions chosen solutions to cope with the problem space.
   A user-survey may provide an initial idea, but users often have no idea of what    they want until they try it.
   A prototype can enable validation and testing, for example: 
   usability testing for a specified target groups of users   (e.g. to determine issues, benchmark different solutions, competitor-   analysis, learnability)

 So it's actually very straightforward. You prototype to evaluate your assumptions, because honestly a user survey doesn't do the trick well enough. A cheap mockup as a non-functional prototype can already help, which is really what you guys are doing in the group work. And such prototypes can help either improving a product or dropping it entirely before spending loads of money on developing something no-one wants. Likely google glass was only created to issue patents on technology...

 As an example for my MSc project this workflow shows how input from the RGB camera and the infrared camera is processed and combined, only to show that the individual steps are feasible.
Top part is the 3D input from a Kinect, which is cropped to whatever happens within a predefined space. 
Bottom part tracks the user's hands, which can be overlayed with the 3D input to remove those voxels, leaving only the object you want to scan.
