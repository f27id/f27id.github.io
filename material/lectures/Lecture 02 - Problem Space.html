# Why? 
 * We know what we are aiming for (usability and a good user  experience) but to get there it is essential to have a clear understanding of why we are designing something - the problem space.
  
 * It is also essential to have a clear understanding of how we are going to design something - thinking about the interaction at a conceptual level.

##  A framework for understanding the problem space 
  * Are there usability or user experience problems with an existing  product or human experience? 
  * What are they?
  * Why are there problems?
  * What is the context - social, technical, physical?
  * How will your design ideas overcome the problems?
  * What kind of concepts are involved in your design?
  * How will your design ideas support, change, or extend current ways  of doing things?

# Usability or user experience problems  
  * User experience goals
  * Satisfying, engaging, helpful, fulfilling, beautiful.
  * Usability goals
  * Does it do (well) what it is intended to do?
  * Effective, efficient, safe, easy to use, learn and remember

## Real v **Ideal**: Another approach towards understanding problem space 

### Ideal:
  * What could the desired system be?  
  * What are the Desirable  products  and activities?
  * What is the possible solution, or the characteristics of a solution?

# Example 1: Exergaming to improve children's **health**
  * Levels of physical inactivity and obesity are very high in children, with fewer than 50 percent of primary school-aged boys and fewer than 28 percent of girls meeting the minimum levels of physical activity  required to maintain health.
  
  * "Exergaming" using active console video games that track player movement to control the game, has become popular, and may provide an alternative form of exercise to counteract sedentary  behaviours.ÿ- Elsevier Heath Science, 2013

## What's the problem space for this? 

First, what's the **"big"** problem we're trying to solve?
 * What exercise do primary school children do now?
 * Are there problems with children's' current experience of exercise? What are they?
 * What are children's current experiences of interactive games technology and exergaming?
 * What activities do (many) children enjoy doing? What do they dislike? Are they different from older people?
 * Why - social, cultural and technological context
 * How will your design ideas overcome the problems?
 * How will your design ideas support, change, or extend current ways of  doing things?

## Example 2: problem space for an existing device 
  * Nature of product - Gaming peripheral
  * Current user experience - Intuitive and satisfying
  * Concepts: Skating, Surfing, Walking and Balancingÿ
  * Areas for improvement - surface area limited, cannot jump (Usability)
  * It is a pressure sensor used in most cases as a weighing device
  * There are some issues with the device but it is far outweighed by the limitations of the software!ÿ

# From the problem space to design 
  * Having a good understanding of the problem space  helps to inform the design
  * Generate a set of research questions to be addressed
  * e.g. what kind of interface, behaviour, functionality to provide
  * But before deciding upon these it is important to develop a conceptual model

# What is a Conceptual Model of interaction? 
  * An abstraction that outlines what people can do with a product and what concepts are needed to  understand how to interact with it.
    -  ".a high-level description of how a system is organised and operates" - Johnson and Henderson, 2002, p26
    -  It is not a description of the user interface

# Conceptualizing the design space 
 
 * Orientation - Enabling the design team to ask specific kinds of questions about how conceptual model will be understood by the targeted users.
 
 * Open-Mindedness - Explore the range of ideas to address the problems identified.
  
 * Common Ground - reduce the chance of misunderstanding and confusion.

# Components of the Conceptual Model 
  * The concepts that people will be exposed to through  the product
  * Objects in the domain, their attributes, relationships  between objects, and the operations you can do with them / they can do
    -  E.g. Objects - files 
    -  Attributes - names, sizes, contents
    -  Operations - saving, deletion, organising
    -  Relationships - a folder contains a file \n

# Components of the Conceptual Model 
  * Often based on metaphors (or analogies)
  * a word or phrase applied to an object or action   to which it is not literally applicable
  * a comparison between two things, often based   on their structure 
  * Using metaphors:
     - take a real-world or familiar thing and use it as   a basic concept for the new design
  * Helps users and designers understand what a   device or system is for and how to use it \n

# Interface metaphors   
  * Metaphors make abstract concepts concrete and easier to    understand
  * Exploit our knowledge of everyday objects so we can    understand and use something unfamiliar
  * Enable users to
  * Conceptualise what we are doing, e.g. surfing the web
  * Conceptualise what an interface is about e.g. the desktop    metaphor
  * Visualise a hidden operation, e.g. putting items into a shopping    trolley to buy later
  * Make it easier for users to learn a new system
  * Help users understand the conceptual model
  * Can be very innovative and enable computer applications to    be made more accessible to a greater diversity of users

 Search engine example
Screen time became a metaphor for allowed time for children or spent time in general.
Describe Twitter/Facebook without a single metaphor

## Problems with Interface Metaphors   
  * May break conventional and cultural rules
    -  e.g. recycle bin placed on desktop
  * Can constrain designers in the way they conceptualise a    problem space
  * Forces users to only understand the system in terms of    the metaphor
  * Designers can use bad existing designs and transfer the    bad parts over
  * Limits designers' imagination in coming up with new    conceptual models
  * Might just choose the wrong metaphor

# Interaction types  
  * Instructing - issuing commands and choosing    options
  * Conversing - interacting with a system as if    having a conversation
  * Manipulating - interacting with objects in a    virtual or physical space by manipulating them 
  * Exploring - moving through a virtual    environment or a physical space
  * Responding - system taking initiative to alert,    describe, show something to users

 
 <aside class='notes'>
 Instructing: typing, menu, speaking command, gesturing, function keys, buttons
Conversing: Can ask questions as well. Simple one word answers to sentences. Google home, alexa. Cumbersome when on the phone.
Manipulating: opening, holding, closing, placing. Hone your knowledge about physical objects. help beginners, experience users work rapidly on a wide range of tasks, infrequent users remember, prevent need for error messages, showing how their actions are furthering their goal, reduce anxiety, gain confidence and feel in control
Effective to use,Efficient to use,Safe to use,Have good utility,Easy to learn,Easy to remember how to use
Not always useful, replace function.
Exploring: 3D environments, smart rooms

# Which interaction type is best?   
  * Depends on the problem space - e.g. the task and the    user
  * Direct manipulation is good for 'doing' types of tasks, e.g.    designing, drawing, flying, driving, sizing windows
  * Issuing instructions is good for repetitive tasks, e.g. spell-   checking, file management 
  * Having a conversation is good for children, computer-   phobic, users with disabilities and specialised tasks (e.g.    phone helplines)
  * Exploration is good for learning and engagement
  * These types can be mixed - but can take longer to learn

# Interface types   
  * Now we can get down to the interface! At least in a general    way
  * Interface types include:
  * Text, menus, speech, joysticks, buttons, gestures..
  * Different types of interface can support the same type of    interaction
  * Speech, buttons, menus and typed commands (and    others) could all support instruction
  * The interface type should support the type of interaction    you are aiming for
  * A joystick or mouse and pointer would support direct    manipulation, but speech input would not

# Other factors to consider!   
  * Paradigms - Questions to be asked and how they should be framed,    the phenomena to be observed.
  * Vision - Utopian (AI will make our lives easier), dystopian (AI will take    away our jobs)
  * Theories - means for analyzing and predicting users performances
  * Models - Based on theories to explain the way user interacts with    interactive technologies
  * Framework - to help designers consider and scope the user    experience for which they are designing

## Project Activity   
  
### Your Problem Space:
 
  * Review the existing apps in the following domain:    Health, Learning, Wellbeing, Social Networking.
  * Who are your users and how do they currently    experience this? What problems do they encounter?

 Get the students to discuss in pairs first, then report back to the rest of the class
If the students find it hard here are some suggestions:
Fridge - which way do you turn the dial to make it colder?
Itunes - what do you do when you run out of space on your ipod?
Passwords: get them to count up how many passwords they have and if they forget them.
Vision itself has a lousy interface

	* The Problem Space
	* Each novel design introduces new concepts and new ways of doing things and new user experiences
	* It solves some problems and creates new ones
	* We need a Conceptual Model to create and understand a new design
