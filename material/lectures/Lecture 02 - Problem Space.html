## Problem Space Example

<div id='left'>
<p data-markdown>

  * Holographic navigation display which overlays GPS navigation instructions on the road ahead and gathers and shares driver statistics
  * An augmented reality navigation system  available in some cars today
  
**Can you tell which one is better and Why?**
</p>
</div>

<div id="right">

   height:auto;
' >
 </div>
 
<aside class='notes'>
Let's consider an example. 
Take a look at the augmented reality displays and holographic navigation systems in the slide.
This technology is available in some cars today.
They are the result of decades of research into human factors of information displays, the driving experience itself, and the suitability of different technologies.
Having said that. 
Some people may not be comfortable using holographic navigation systems and chosen not to have one installed.[pause]
When you articulate the problem space, you would do this as a team to get the best results.
As in the example, you might find one interface better but your team mates might disagree with you.

# Why? 
 * We know what we are **aiming for** (usability and a good user  experience) but to **get there** it is essential to have a clear understanding of **why** we are designing something 
   - the problem space
  
 * It is also essential to have a clear understanding of **how** we are going to design something 
   - thinking about the interaction at a **conceptual level**
 
 
<aside class='notes'>
 The key question is? Why?
 We know our primary aim is usability and good user experience. 
 But to get there, we need to understand why we are designing something? 
 And this can be attributed to as the problem space.
 It is essential to have clear understanding of how we are going to design something. 
 To think about this interaction problem at the conceptual level.

###  A framework for understanding the problem space 
  1. Are there **usability or user experience problems** with an existing  product or human experience? 
  2. **What** are they?
  3. Why are there **problems**?
  4. What is the **context** - social, technical, physical?
  5. How will your design ideas overcome the problems?
  6. What **kind of concepts** are involved in your design?
  7. How will your design ideas support, change, or extend current ways  of doing things?
 
<aside class='notes'>
 The following framework is one way to help us understand the problem space.
 Number one. Are there any usability or user experience problems with a existing products or human experiences. Remember, we are looking to a product and human experience when they interact with the product.
 Number two. What are these problems. At this stage, pinpoint the problems with interaction or user experience.
 Number three. Why are there problems. There are always reasons for problems. Try to understand those reasons.
 Number Four. What is the context of the problem. 
 The context could be social, technical or physical.
   A social example is when using a product in a particular social context. 
   A technical example could be a technically challenging game for children with disabilities. 
   A physical example could be using a pen-based interaction on a small screen.
 Number Five. How will your proposed design overcome the identified problems.
 Number Six. What kind of concepts are involved in your design.
 And Finally, how will your design ideas support, change, or extend currents of ways of doing things.

## Usability or User Experience **Problems**  
  * What are the **Usability** **goals**?
    * Does the solution do what it was **intended** to do?
  * Is the solution effective, efficient, safe, easy to use, learn and remember?
  * What are the **User Experience goals**?
    * Satisfying, engaging, helpful, fulfilling, beautiful
 
<aside class='notes'>
To understand usability or user experience problems, it is essential to know the usability and user experience goals.
The usability goals are to determine if a product does well, what it is intended to do? 
If an interactive system is effective, efficient, safe, easy to use, and easy to learn and remember.
For example, the product needs to be easy to learn so that new users can use it immediately, and it should be memorable for more frequent users. 
Users won't want to wait around for the product to display fancy maps or provide unnecessary details,so it needs to be efficient and safe to use; that is, it needs to be able to deal easily with user errors.
The user experience goals include  satisfaction, engaging, helpful, fulfilling, and aesthetically beautiful.
Many of these are subjective qualities and are concerned with how a system feels to a user. 
They differ from the more objective usability goals in that they are concerned with how users experience an interactive product from their perspective, rather than assessing how
useful or productive a system is from its own perspective

### Example 1: Exergaming to improve children's **health**
  * **Levels** of physical **inactivity** and obesity are very high in children, with fewer than 50 percent of primary school-aged boys and fewer than 28 percent of girls meeting the minimum levels of physical activity  required to maintain health.
  
  * "Exergaming" using active console **video games** that track player movement to control the game, has become popular, and may provide an alternative form of exercise to counteract sedentary  behaviours - Elsevier Heath Science, 2013 
 
<aside class='notes'>
 In this example, we look at exergaming to improve children's health.
 Do you know what exergaming is?  
 Exergaming is used to describe games that allow players to perform exercise, also known as , fitness games, exercise-gaming, or gamercising. 
 Examples of exergaming are the Wii , Nike Kinnect, Nintendo Fitness Boxing, X Box fitness.
 Levels of physical inactivity and obesity are very high in children. 
 Less than 50 percent of primary school aged boys and fewer than 28 percent of girls meet the minimum levels of physical activity required to maintain health.
 Exergaming using active console video games that track player movement to control the game, has become popular. It may provide an alternative form of exercise to counteract sedentary behavious. 
 As reported in research published in Elsevier Health Science in 2013.

 Lets take a look at another example to understand the problem space.
 In this example, we are trying to understand the problem space for an existing gaming peripheral. 
 You can see this is clearly outlined in the bullet point list.
 What is the nature of the product. It is a gaming peripheral. I suppose we all know what a gaming perhipheral is. 
 The current device as shown in the image, uses the concepts for skating, surfing, walking and balancing.
 Is there a problem with the current device. 
 What are the areas for improvement? The first problem seems to be limited surface area. This causes usability issues as limited area is not suitable for jumping.
 The device is used as a pressure sensor used in most cases as a weighing device.
 There are some issues with the device but it is far outweighed by the limitations of the software.

## Other **Examples** for you to Consider
  * Interface to allow for better **socializing** in the pub
  * Interface that tracks your energy usage at the **home** and provides alerts, suggestions
  * Interface that tracks the **medicine intake** of patients at home
  * Design that is easy to use online for home furniture **shopping**
  * An intelligent **photo holder** interface that connects parents and children who are distant
 
<aside class='notes'>
 Lets talk about some other examples.
 The first example, is an interface to allow for better socializing in the pub. It could be a software application or a web app.
 Another example is an interface that tracks your energy usage in the home and provides alerts, suggestions. This is commonly used on mobile apps.
 Then there is an interface for tracking the medicine intake of patients at home.
 How would you design an easy to use online tool for home furniture shopping. For instance, you could take a look at the IKKEA online furniture selection tool and see how they do it.
 A final example, would be an intelligent photo holder interface that connects parents and children who are distant.

## Challenge any claims and assumptions

<aside class='notes'>
  Sometimes assumptions can be wrong and misleading.
  You should challenge any claims or assumptions.
  Assumptions are when you assuming or taking something for granted without any evidence or test.
  For example, when you assume people want to watch TV in the car.
  
  A claim is when you state something is true when it is still open to question.
  For example, using speech to control the GPS while driving is safe.
  Now looking at the two examples, we can conclude that assumptions and claims could lead to incorrect judgement of the situation.
  Writing down your assumptions and claims and then trying to defend and support them can highlight those that are vague or wanting. 
  In so doing, poorly constructed design ideas can be reformulated.

#### Future: 3D TV? 
## Assumptions - reasonable or not?
  * People would **not mind** wearing the **glasses**  that are needed to see in 3D in their living rooms?
  * People would **not mind** **paying** a **lot** more for  a new 3D-enabled TV screen?
  * People would really enjoy the **enhanced**  clarity and colour **detail** provided by 3D?
  * People will be happy carrying around their own special glasses

 Lets review the assumptions about 3D television and see if they are reasonable or not.
 People would not mind wearing the glasses that are needed to see in 3D in their living rooms.
 People would not mind paying a lot more for a new 3D-enabled TV screen.
 People would really enjoy the enhanced clarity and colour detail provided by 3D.
 People will be happy carrying around their own special glasses.
 Would you agree with these assumptions?

## From the **problem space** to **design**
  * Having a **good understanding of the problem space**  helps to **inform the design**
  * Generate a set of research questions to be addressed

  * But before deciding upon these it is important to develop a **conceptual model** 
 
<aside class='notes'>
 After identifying the problem space, we move to the design phase.
 Having a good understanding of the problem space helps to inform the design.
 In this phase we generate a set of research questions to be addressed.
 For example, what kind of interface is needed? What behaviour is expected? What functionality will the product provide?
 But before deciding upon these. it is important to develop a conceptual model.

## **What** is a Conceptual Model of interaction? 
  * An **abstraction** that outlines what people **can do** with a product and what concepts are needed to  understand how to interact with it.
    -  A **high-level description** of how a system is organised and operates" - Johnson and Henderson, 2002, p26
    -  It is **not** a description of the user interface  
  
 
<aside class='notes'>
  So what is a Conceptual Model of interaction? 
  A model is a simplified description of a system or process that helps describe how it works. 
The conceptual model used in interaction design is for articulating the problem and design space.
What is more, the conceptual model is a high-level description of how a system is organized and operates. It is not a description of the user interface.

 Lets take a look at Conceptualizing the design space.
 This is divided into three areas.
 Orientation, open-mindedness and common-ground.

  * The concepts that people will be exposed to through  the product
  * **Objects** in the domain, their attributes, relationships  between objects, and the operations you can do with them / they can do 
    - Example of Objects - files
      -  **Attributes** - names, sizes, contents
      -  **Operations** - saving, deletion, organising
      -  **Relationships** - a folder contains a file

  Objects in the domain, their attributes, relationships  between objects, and the operations you can do with them / they can do
  For examples  Object are files.
  The file Attributes are names, sizes, contents.
  The Operations that a user can perform are saving, deletion, organising.

## Components of the **Conceptual Model**
  * Often based on **metaphors** (or **analogies**)
  * a word or phrase applied to an object or action   to which it is not literally applicable
  * a comparison between two things, often based   on their structure 
  * Using metaphors:
     - take a real-world or familiar thing and use it as a basic concept for the new design
  * Helps users and designers understand what a device or system is for and how to use it 

<aside class='notes'>
The conceptual model uses metaphors and analogies for example Desktop, spreadsheet, recycle bin, web, search engine. These terms are metaphorically used on your windows operating system.
What are Metphors. Metaphors and analogies that convey to people how to understand what a product is used for and how to use it for an activity. Take a real-world or familiar thing and use it as a basic concept for the new design.
For example browsing and bookmarking. These are concepts. You don't really browse them, do you? Similarly, when you bookmark a page, it is not bookmarked in reality, but we are using a bookmark analogy.
Metaphors help users and designers to understanding what a device or system is for and how to use it.

  The Star interface, developed by Xerox in 1981, revolutionized the way that interfaces were designed for personal computing.
  Originally, Xerox was designed as an office system, targeted at workers not interested in computing and it was based on a conceptual model that included the familiar knowledge of an office.
  Paper, folders, filing cabinets, and mailboxes were represented as icons on the screen and were designed to possess some of the properties of their physical counterparts. 
  Similarly, Dragging a document icon across the desktop screen was seen as equivalent to picking up a piece of paper in the physical world and moving it.

## **Example**: A material metaphor   
A card metaphor is very popular with user interfaces because:

* Has a familiar form
* Material properties are    added, giving    appearance and physical    behaviour, e.g. surface    of paper

 An interface metaphor that has become popular in the last few years is the card. Many of the social media apps, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest, present their content on
cards. Cards have a familiar form, having been around for a long time. Just think of how many kinds there are: playing cards, business cards, birthday cards, credit cards, and postcards to name a few.
They can easily be flicked through, sorted, and themed.

## Interaction types  
  * **Instructing** - issuing commands and choosing    options
  * **Conversing** - interacting with a system as if    having a conversation
  * **Manipulating** - interacting with objects in a    virtual or physical space by manipulating them 
  * **Exploring** - moving through a virtual    environment or a physical space
  * **Responding** - system taking initiative to alert,    describe, show something to users

 
<aside class='notes'>
   Interaction types. This is important to interaction types.
 Instructing is an interaction type when users issue commands or choose options. For example, typing, menu, speaking command, gesturing, function keys, buttons.
Conversing is an intereaction  when user is having a coversation with the system. For example, user can ask questions as well. Simple one word answers to sentences. Google home, alexa. It can be cumbersome when on the phone.
Manipulating is interaction type in which user interact with objects in a virtual or physical space by manipulating them. For example opening, holding, closing, placing. 
Hone your knowledge about physical objects. help beginners, experience users work rapidly on a wide range of tasks, infrequent users remember, prevent need for error messages, showing how their actions are furthering their goal, reduce anxiety, gain confidence and feel in control.
Exploring refers to moving through virtual or physical space. For example 3D environments, smart rooms.
Responding refers to system taking initiative to alert, describe and show something to users.
Good interaction provides good user experience. Systems are Effective to use,Efficient and Safe to use. Products have good utility, Easy to learn and Easy to remember how to use.

# **Which** interaction type is **best**?   
  * **Depends** on the problem space - e.g. the task and the    user
  * Direct manipulation is good for 'doing' types of tasks, e.g.    designing, drawing, flying, driving, sizing windows
  * Issuing instructions is **good** for **repetitive** tasks, e.g. spell-checking, file management 
  * Having a conversation is good for children, computer-   phobic, users with disabilities and specialised tasks (e.g.    phone helplines)
  * **Exploration** is good for learning and engagement
  * These types can be mixed - but can take **longer** to learn

  * Different types of interface can support the same type of    interaction
    * Speech, buttons, menus and typed commands (and    others) could all support instruction

   You are expected to identify your users and how do they currently experience this? What problems do they encounter?   
Here are some suggestions:
Fridge. which way do you turn the dial to make it colder?
Itunes. what do you do when you run out of space on your ipod?
Passwords. Count up how many passwords you have and if it is hard to remember them.
Think of Vision, the VLE. Do you see any issues?
