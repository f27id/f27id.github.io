 Understanding problem space. Deciding what to design is key, and exploring the problem space is one way in which to
 decide. This is the first step in designing an interaction system.
 For example, consider the augmented reality displays and holographic navigation systems that are available in some cars nowadays.
 They are the result of decades of research into human factors of information displays, the driving experience itself, and the suitability of different technologies.
 Having said that, some people may not be comfortable using a holographic navigation system and choose not to have one installed.[pause]
 The process of articulating the problem space is typically done as a team effort.

# Why? 
 * We know what we are aiming for (usability and a good user  experience) but to get there it is essential to have a clear understanding of why we are designing something - the problem space.
  
 * It is also essential to have a clear understanding of how we are going to design something - thinking about the interaction at a conceptual level.
 
 
 <aside class='notes'>
 The key question is? Why we are designing something?
 Our primary aim is usability and good user experience. 
 But to get there, we need to understand why we are designing something? And this can attributed as problem space.
 It is essential to have clear understanding of how we are going to design something. Thinking about the interaction at a conceptual level.

##  A framework for understanding the problem space 
  * Are there usability or user experience problems with an existing  product or human experience? 
  * What are they?
  * Why are there problems?
  * What is the context - social, technical, physical?
  * How will your design ideas overcome the problems?
  * What kind of concepts are involved in your design?
  * How will your design ideas support, change, or extend current ways  of doing things?
 
 <aside class='notes'>
 Understanding problem space. We propose the following framework to understand the problem space.
 Number one. Are there any usability or user experience problems with an existing product or human experience. Remember, we are looking to a product and human experience when they interact with the product.
 Number two. What are these problems. At this stage, pinpoint the problems with interaction or user experience.
 Number three. Why are there problems. There are always reasons for problems. Try to understand those reasons.
 Number Four. What is the context of the problem. 
 Social. For example using a product in a particular social context. 
 Technical. For example a technically challenging game for children with disabilities. 
 Physical problem. For example using pen-based interactions on small screens.
 Number Five. How will your proposed design overcome the identified problems.
 Number Six. What kind of concepts are involved in your design.
 And Finally, how will your design ideas support, change, or extend currents of ways of doing things.

# Usability or user experience problems  
  * Usability goals
  * Does it do (well) what it is intended to do?
  * Effective, efficient, safe, easy to use, learn and remember  
  * User experience goals
  * Satisfying, engaging, helpful, fulfilling, beautiful
 
 <aside class='notes'>
 To understand usability or user experience problems, it is essential to know usability and user experience goals.
According to I S O standards, the key usability attributes are effectiveness, efficiency, user statisfaction. 
The usability goals are to determine if a product does well, what it is intended to do? 
If an interactive system is effective, efficient, safe, easy to use, easy to learn and remember.
For example, the product needs to be easy to learn so that new users can use it immediately, and it should be memorable for more frequent users. 
Users wonâ€™t want to wait around for the product to display fancy maps or provide unnecessary detail,so it needs to be efficient and safe to use; that is, it needs to be able to deal easily with user errors.
The user experience goals include  satisfaction, engaging, helpful, fulfilling, and aesthetically beautiful.
Many of these are subjective qualities and are concerned with how a system feels to a user. 
They differ from the more objective usability goals in that they are concerned with how users experience an interactive product from their perspective, rather than assessing how
useful or productive a system is from its own perspective

## Real v **Ideal**: Another approach towards understanding problem space 

### Ideal:
  * What could the desired system be?  
  * What are the Desirable  products  and activities?
  * What is the possible solution, or the characteristics of a solution?
 
 <aside class='notes'>
 Another approach towards understanding problem space is. Ideal versus Real.
 Ideal. What could the desired system be.
 What are the desireable products and activities.
 And finally, what is the possible solution or the characteristics of a solution.

# Example 1: Exergaming to improve children's **health**
  * Levels of physical inactivity and obesity are very high in children, with fewer than 50 percent of primary school-aged boys and fewer than 28 percent of girls meeting the minimum levels of physical activity  required to maintain health.
  
  * "Exergaming" using active console video games that track player movement to control the game, has become popular, and may provide an alternative form of exercise to counteract sedentary  behaviours.Ã¿- Elsevier Heath Science, 2013 
 
 <aside class='notes'>
 Let's have a look at example one. In this example, we look at exergaming to improve children's health.
 Do you know what exergaming is.  Fitness game, exergaming or exer gaming, or gamercising is a term used for video games that are also a form of exercise. 
 Examples of exergaming are: Wii , Nike Kinnect, Nintendo Fitness Boxing, X Box fitness etc.
 Levels of physical inactivity and obesity are very high in children. 
 Less than 50 percent of primary school aged boys and fewer than 28 percent of girls meet the minimum levels of physical activity required to maintain health.
 Exergaming using active console video games that track player movement to control the game, has become popular. It may provide an alternative form of exercise to counteract sedentary behavious. Reported in research published in Elsevier Health Science in 2013.

## What's the problem space for this? 

First, what's the **"big"** problem we're trying to solve?
 * What exercise do primary school children do now?
 * Are there problems with children's' current experience of exercise? What are they?
 * What are children's current experiences of interactive games technology and exergaming?
 * What activities do (many) children enjoy doing? What do they dislike? Are they different from older people?
 * Why - social, cultural and technological context
 * How will your design ideas overcome the problems?
 * How will your design ideas support, change, or extend current ways of  doing things?
 
 
 <aside class='notes'>
What is the problem space for this.
The key question is. What is the big problem we are trying to solve here? Given the problem context, we need answers to the following questions.
What exercise do primary school children do now?
Are there problems with children's current experience of exercise? What are they?
What are children's current experiences of interactive games technology and exergaming?
What activities do many children enjoy doing? What do they dislike? Are they different from older people?
Remeber the previous slide. Understanding the problem context. For example, social, cultural and technological context
Now think about your design concept.
How will your design ideas overcome the problems?
How will your design ideas support, change, or extend current ways of  doing things?

## Example 2: problem space for an existing device 
  * Nature of product - Gaming peripheral
  * Current user experience - Intuitive and satisfying
  * Concepts: Skating, Surfing, Walking and Balancing
  * Areas for improvement - surface area limited, cannot jump (Usability)
  * It is a pressure sensor used in most cases as a weighing device
  * There are some issues with the device but it is far outweighed by the limitations of the software!

 Lets take a look at another example to understand problem space.
 In this example, we are trying to understand problem space for an existing gaming peripheral. 
 You can see this is clearly outlined in the bullet point list.
 What is the nature of the product. It is a gaming peripheral. I suppose we all know what a gaming perhipheral is. 
 The current device as shown in the image, uses the concepts for skating, surfing, walking and balancing.
 Is there a problem with the current device. 
 What are the areas for improvement? The first problem seems to be limited surface area. This causes usability issues as limited area is not suitable for jumping.
 The device is used as a pressure sensor used in most cases as a weighing device.
 There are some issues with the device but it is far outweighed by the limitations of the software.

 Lets talk about some other examples.
 Interface to allow for better socializing in the pub. It could be software app or web app.
 Interface that tracks your energy usage at the home and provides alerts, suggestions. This is commonly used on mobile apps.
 Interface that tracks the medicine intake of patients at home.
 Design an easy to use online tool for home furniture shopping. You can take a look at IKEA online furniture selection tool.
 An intelligent photo holder interface that connects parents and children who are distant.

# Challenge any claims and assumptions 
  * Assumption: Taking something for granted when we should test it
  * "People want to watch TV in the car"

 <aside class='notes'>
  Assumptions can be wrong and misleading.
  Challenge any claims and assumptions.
  What is Assumption. It is assuming something for granted without any evidence or test.
  For example, assuming that people want to watch TV in the car.
  What is claim. Stating that something is true when it is still open to question.
  For example, using speech to control GPS while driving is safe.
  Now looking at the two examples, we can conclude that assumptions and claims could lead to incorrect judgement of the situation.
  Writing down your assumptions and claims and then trying to defend and support them can highlight those that are vague or wanting. 
  In so doing, poorly constructed design ideas can be reformulated.

 <aside class='notes'>
 After identifying the problem space, we move to the design phase.
 Having a good understanding of the problem space helps to inform the design.
 In this phase we generate a set of research questions to be addressed.
 For example, what kind of interface is needed? What behaviour is expected? What functionality will the product provide?
 But before deciding upon these it is important to develop a conceptual model.

  What is a Conceptual Model of interaction? 
  A model is a simplified description of a system or process that helps describe how it works. 
Conceptual model used in interaction design to articulate the problem and design space.
Conceptual model is a high-level description of how a system is organized and operates. It is not a description of the user interface.

# Components of the Conceptual Model 
  * The concepts that people will be exposed to through  the product
  * Objects in the domain, their attributes, relationships  between objects, and the operations you can do with them / they can do
    -  E.g. Objects - files 
    -  Attributes - names, sizes, contents
    -  Operations - saving, deletion, organising
    -  Relationships - a folder contains a file \n 

 
 <aside class='notes'>
  Lets look at the components of the Conceptual Model.
  The concepts that people will be exposed to through  the product
  Objects in the domain, their attributes, relationships  between objects, and the operations you can do with them / they can do
  For examples  Object are files.
  The file Attributes are names, sizes, contents.
  The Operations that a user can perform are saving, deletion, organising.
  Relationships between objects and concepts - a folder contains a file.

# Components of the Conceptual Model 
  * Often based on metaphors (or analogies)
  * a word or phrase applied to an object or action   to which it is not literally applicable
  * a comparison between two things, often based   on their structure 
  * Using metaphors:
     - take a real-world or familiar thing and use it as a basic concept for the new design
  * Helps users and designers understand what a device or system is for and how to use it \n 

 <aside class='notes'>
The conceptual mdoel uses metaphors and analogies for example Desktop, spreadsheet, recycle bin, web, search engine. These terms are metaphorically used on your windows operating system.
What are Metphors. Metaphors and analogies that convey to people how to understand what a product is used for and how to use it for an activity. Take a real-world or familiar thing and use it as a basic concept for the new design.
For example browsing and bookmarking. These are concepts. You don't really browse, do you? Similarly, when you bookmark a page, it is not bookmarked in reality, but we are using a bookmark analogy.
Metaphors help users and designers to understanding what a device or system is for and how to use it.

# Interface metaphors   
  * Metaphors make abstract concepts concrete and easier to   understand
  * Exploit our knowledge of everyday objects so we can    understand and use something unfamiliar
  * Enable users to
  * Conceptualise what we are doing, e.g. surfing the web
  * Conceptualise what an interface is about e.g. the desktop    metaphor
  * Visualise a hidden operation, e.g. putting items into a shopping    trolley to buy later
  * Make it easier for users to learn a new system
  * Help users understand the conceptual model
  * Can be very innovative and enable computer applications to    be made more accessible to a greater diversity of users

  Interface metaphors. 
  These make abstract concepts concrete and easier to understand.
  Exploit our knowledge of everyday objects so we can understand and use something unfamiliar.
  These Enable users to Conceptualise what we are doing, e.g. surfing the web
  Conceptualise what an interface is about e.g. the desktop metaphor.
  Visualise a hidden operation, e.g. putting items into a shopping trolley to buy later
  Make it easier for users to learn a new system.
  These Help users understand the conceptual model.
  These Can be very innovative and enable computer applications to be made more accessible to a greater diversity of users.
 For example Search engine.
Screen time became a metaphor for allowed time for children or spent time in general.
Metaphor used to explain something hard to grasp with a familiar concept.

  The Star interface, developed by Xerox in 1981, revolutionized the way that interfaces were designed for personal computing.
  Originally, Xerox was designed as an office system, targeted at workers not interested in computing and it was based on a conceptual model that included the familiar knowledge of an office.
  Paper, folders, filing cabinets, and mailboxes were represented as icons on the screen and were designed to possess some of the properties of their physical counterparts. 
  Similarly, Dragging a document icon across the desktop screen was seen as equivalent to picking up a piece of paper in the physical world and moving it.

## Example: A material metaphor   
  * The card is a very  popular user interface  metaphor
  * Why?
  * Has a familiar form
  * Material properties are    added, giving    appearance and physical    behaviour, e.g. surface    of paper

 An interface metaphor that has become popular in the last few years is the card. Many of the social media apps, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest, present their content on
cards. Cards have a familiar form, having been around for a long time. Just think of how many kinds there are: playing cards, business cards, birthday cards, credit cards, and postcards to name a few.
They can easily be flicked through, sorted, and themed.

## Problems with Interface Metaphors   
  * May break conventional and cultural rules
    -  e.g. recycle bin placed on desktop
  * Can constrain designers in the way they conceptualise a    problem space
  * Forces users to only understand the system in terms of    the metaphor
  * Designers can use bad existing designs and transfer the    bad parts over
  * Limits designers' imagination in coming up with new    conceptual models
  * Might just choose the wrong metaphor

  Lets discuss roblems with Interface Metaphors.  
  These may break conventional and cultural rules. for example recycle bin placed on desktop. This does not happen in real world.
  These Can constrain designers in the way they conceptualise a problem space.
  Interface metaphors forces users to only understand the system in terms of the metaphor.
  The Designers can use bad existing designs and transfer the  bad parts over.
  It Limits designers imagination in coming up with new conceptual models.
  Some might just choose the wrong metaphor.  </aside>

# Interaction types  
  * Instructing - issuing commands and choosing    options
  * Conversing - interacting with a system as if    having a conversation
  * Manipulating - interacting with objects in a    virtual or physical space by manipulating them 
  * Exploring - moving through a virtual    environment or a physical space
  * Responding - system taking initiative to alert,    describe, show something to users

 
 <aside class='notes'>
   Interaction types. This is important to interaction types.
 Instructing is an interaction type when users issue commands or choose options. For example, typing, menu, speaking command, gesturing, function keys, buttons.
Conversing is an intereaction  when user is having a coversation with the system. For example, user can ask questions as well. Simple one word answers to sentences. Google home, alexa. It can be cumbersome when on the phone.
Manipulating is interaction type in which user interact with objects in a virtual or physical space by manipulating them. For example opening, holding, closing, placing. 
Hone your knowledge about physical objects. help beginners, experience users work rapidly on a wide range of tasks, infrequent users remember, prevent need for error messages, showing how their actions are furthering their goal, reduce anxiety, gain confidence and feel in control.
Exploring refers to moving through virtual or physical space. For example 3D environments, smart rooms.
Responding refers to system taking initiative to alert, describe and show something to users.
Good interaction provides good user experience. Systems are Effective to use,Efficient and Safe to use. Products have good utility, Easy to learn and Easy to remember how to use.

# Which interaction type is best?   
  * Depends on the problem space - e.g. the task and the    user
  * Direct manipulation is good for 'doing' types of tasks, e.g.    designing, drawing, flying, driving, sizing windows
  * Issuing instructions is good for repetitive tasks, e.g. spell-   checking, file management 
  * Having a conversation is good for children, computer-   phobic, users with disabilities and specialised tasks (e.g.    phone helplines)
  * Exploration is good for learning and engagement
  * These types can be mixed - but can take longer to learn

# Interface types   
  * Now we can get down to the interface! At least in a general    way
  * Interface types include:
  * Text, menus, speech, joysticks, buttons, gestures..
  * Different types of interface can support the same type of    interaction
  * Speech, buttons, menus and typed commands (and    others) could all support instruction
  * The interface type should support the type of interaction    you are aiming for
  * A joystick or mouse and pointer would support direct    manipulation, but speech input would not

 Now we can get down to the interface! At least in a general way [pause].
Interface types include:
Text, menus, speech, joysticks, buttons, gestures etc.
Remember, different types of interface can support the same type of interaction.
For example Speech, buttons, menus and typed commands could all support instruction.
The interface type should support the type of interaction you are aiming for.
For example, A joystick or mouse and pointer would support direct manipulation, but speech input would not.

## Project Activity   
  
### Your Problem Space:
 
  * Review the existing apps in the following domain:    Health, Learning, Wellbeing, Social Networking.
  * Who are your users and how do they currently    experience this? What problems do they encounter?   

 
 <aside class='notes'>
   In the face to face session, you will be asked to discuss this activity. Please, review existing apps in the domains such as Health, Learning, wellbeing, social Networking.
   You are expected to identify your users and how do they currently experience this? What problems do they encounter?   
Here are some suggestions:
Fridge. which way do you turn the dial to make it colder?
Itunes. what do you do when you run out of space on your ipod?
Passwords. Count up how many passwords you have and if it is hard to remember them.
Think of Vision, the VLE. Do you see any issues?
We will discuss this in the live session.
