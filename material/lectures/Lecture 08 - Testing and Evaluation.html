	## Overview

	* Goals and benefits of **Testing and Evaluating** Designs
	* Different types of **user-based** testing
	* **Qualitative and Quantitative** Data
	* Details on experimental research in HCI   
	* Questions and Discussion
		
<aside class='notes'>
Students seem to have relatively little difficulty with the concept of testing. They believe it has to be done, and few have a problem with the process. One problem: in the press of time they may tend to fall back on family and friends. This is not a total loss so long as they are getting performance measures: the time to find something isn't warped because the user is your brother. Preference measures are less reliable: of course your mother is going to think it's a great site. Suggest they concentrate on performance.

## Goals of **Evaluation**
  * Assess **extent** of system functionality
  * Assess **effect** of interface on user
  * Identify specific **problems**
  * Designers need to **check** whether their ideas are really what users **need/want**; or whether the final product works as expected.
  * To do that, we need some form of methods, or more specifically, **empirical methods** for HCI

## The Goals of **Testing** 
#### Discover errors and areas of improvement in:
* **Performance** -- How much time, and how many steps, are required for    people to complete basic tasks? (For example, find something to buy,    create a new account, and order the item.)
* **Accuracy** -- How many mistakes did people make? (And were they fatal    or recoverable with the right information?)
* **Recall** -- How much does the person remember afterwards or after    periods of non-use?
* **Emotional response** -- How does the person feel about the tasks    completed? Is the person confident, stressed? Would the user    recommend this system to a friend?   
 
<aside class='notes'>
Usability testing is a black-box testing technique. The aim is to observe people using the product to discover errors and areas of improvement. Usability testing generally involves measuring how well test subjects respond in four areas: efficiency, accuracy, recall, and emotional response. The results of the first test can be treated as a baseline or control measurement; all subsequent tests can then be compared to the baseline to indicate improvement.

The generic goal of most evaluations is to provide "useful feedback" to a variety of audiences including sponsors, donors, client-groups, administrators, staff, and other relevant constituencies.
The major goal of evaluation is to influence decision-making or policy formulation through the provision of empirically-driven feedback.

#### Remember
## What is Usability?

<aside class='notes'>
Let's start by reviewing, what is usability?
</aside>
 
</textarea>
</section>
 
 
<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
## Usability 
  * Usability refers to the **extent** to which a product **can be used** by specified users to achieve specified goals with    effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified    context of user (ISO 9241-11)
  * Usability **measures** the quality of a **user's experience**    when interacting with a product or system
    - Ease of learning
    - Efficiency of use
    - Memorability
    - Error frequency and severity
    - Subjective satisfaction

## User-based **evaluation**
  * Considered to yield the most **reliable** and valid estimate of an **application's usability**
  * In a typical user-based evaluation, test subjects are asked to    perform a set of tasks with the technology.
  * Depending on the primary focus of the evaluator, the users' success    at completing the tasks and their speed of performance may be    recorded.
  * Large sample of users would be good, but 3 (**Lewis**) or 5 (**Nielsen**)    are often enough to uncover the majority of problems.
  * **Nielsen**: "once it is found that two or three people are totally confused by the home page, little is gained by watching more    people suffer through the same flawed design"   
 
<aside class='notes'>
In an ideal world user testing with a large sample of the intended user population would routinely occur, however due to resource limitations, user-based tests are often constrained. As a result, there is considerable interest among HCI professionals in determining how to gain the most information from the smallest sample of users. While popular myths exist about being able to determine a majority of problems with only 2 or 3 users, Lewis (1994) has shown that the sample size requirement is largely dependent on the type of errors one seeks to identify and their relative probability of occurrence. Whereas 3 users might identify many problems in a new application, substantially more users will be required to tease out the remaining problems in a mature or revised product.

In the early 1990s, Jakob Nielsen, at that time a researcher at Sun Microsystems, popularized the concept of using numerous small usability tests-typically with only five test subjects each-at various stages of the development process. His argument is that, once it is found that two or three people are totally confused by the home page, little is gained by watching more people suffer through the same flawed design

## Certain **Categories** of evaluation   
#### **User-based** evaluations: where a sample of the intended users try to    use the application
  * **Lab studies** (experimental research, Usability testing), field studies
  * **Observation Methods** (think aloud, video analysis)
  * **Questionnaires**, Interviews, Focus Groups
  * Some are Quantitative others are Qualitative

 
<aside class='notes'>
Certain Categories of evaluation include:
User-based evaluations: where a sample of the intended users try to    use the application.
lab-based studies.
Observation Methods.
Questionnaires, Interviews and Focus Group.
You should be aware that the different evaluation methods are not all quantitative but can also be Qualitative.

### Method **Selection**
The evaluation **approach influences** the methods used, and in turn, how data is collected, analyzed and presented
  
  * E.g., **Field studies typically**:
    - Involve observation and interviews.
    - Do not involve controlled tests in a laboratory.
    - Produce qualitative data.
  
  * E.g., **Usability testing typically**:
    - Involves users, interviews, design, questionnaires.
    - Conducted in the laboratory or in a natural setting.
    - Primary goal is to test how usable the interface is with intended populations.

</textarea>
</section>

 
<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
### **Quantitative** or **Qualitative**?   
  * Data is either Qualitative or Quantitative
    * e.g. Interview-based data is Qualitative
  * Questionnaires can be Quantitative (ratings-based), Qualitative (short-questions)
  * Other forms of Quantitative data includes
    * time taken to do a task, performance 
  * Selection **depends** on:
    * Overall research or evaluation goal
    * Ethical and practical issues
    * Resources, cost, logistics	
    * Availability of participants and sample size
    * Skills of team, background, philosophy
    * One is more rigid than the other
  * Hence an evaluation proposal is imperative   
 
<aside class='notes'>
The question of whether you use Quantitative or Qualitative approaches depends on a number of factors.

## Reliability, Validity and Scope   
  * Can the study be replicated: **reliability**
  * Are you measuring what you expect: **validity**
  * Are there any unexpected effects: **bias**
  * Can the findings be generalised: **scope**

## New, adapt or reuse?   
  * **Established questionnaires** will give more reliable and repeatable results than ad-hoc questionnaires. 
  * Some questionnaires for assessing the perceived usability of an    interactive system: 
    * Questionnaire for **User Interface Satisfaction** (QUIS) (1988)
    * **Computer System Usability** Questionnaire (CSUQ) (1995) 
    * **System Usability Scale** (SUS) (1996)

## Observations / Video Coding   
  * E.g. Child Robot Interaction Evaluation    Setup
    * Video Analysis 
  
  * E.g., measuring engagement through calculating duration of
    * Child eye-gaze facing robot,
    * Facial and Verbal Expressions,
    * Gestures

## Interviews 

* analyst questions user on one-to-one basis usually based on **prepared questions**
* informal, subjective and relatively cheap

---

* Advantages 
  * can be varied to suit context 
  * issues can be explored more fully 
  * can elicit user views and identify unanticiapted problems 

* Disadvantages
  * very subjective 
  * time consuming

<aside class='notes'>
Interviews are a popular approach as they provide an informal way to explore details cheaply.
However, they have both advantages and disadvantages.
Such as they can be varied to suit context and issues can be explored more fully.
But can also be very subjective and time consuming.

### Interview **Example**    
  * **Goal:** To understand behaviours and roles for social robots in    Education
  * **Users:** School Teachers 
  * **Method:** Interview
  * E.g. Interview questions include:
    * How do you think a robot can contribute towards efficient language    learning?
    * How do you want a robot to show different gestures during a one to one    interaction? 
    * How do you want a robot to display a personality according to a child? 
    * How do you want a robot to react to children emotions?
    * What kind of role a robot should play to improve learning?
    * How do you want a robot to store child's memory?
 
 
<aside class='notes'>
Take a look at the following example. 
Investigates the behaviours and roles for social robots in Education by observing teachers.
The method used is an interview and uses some of the following questions.
How do you think a robot can contribute towards efficient language    learning.
How do you want a robot to display a personality according to a child.
How do you want a robot to store child's memory.

## Field Trials 

* Useful for 
  - Interacting with users 
  - Getting ideas for later versions

---
  
* **Advantages**
  - natural environments (and evaluator can view system as part of the total environment )
  - context retained (though observation may alter it)
  - longitudinal studies possible 
  
* **Disadvantages**
  - distractions 
  - noise 
  
* Appropriate
  - where context is crucial for longitudinal studies 
  
  
<!--
* Conducted in users' environments, so therefore contextual
  - and evaluator can view system as part of the total environment 
  
* Method can include many of the laboratory techniques 
* Problems 
  - Interruptions 
  - Difficult to control 
  - Considered 'unscientific'

## Focus Groups 

* **Discussion based group interview** 
  - Originated during the 2nd world war - used to test effectiveness of propaganda
  - Often used today for market research 
* Features 
  - Comprises people with a particular set of characteristics 
  - Moderated (often by the researcher)
  - Tend to be relatively informal 
  - Centres **around open questions designed to generate dynamic discussion** 
  - (participants may also be required to complete a questionnaire)

  * Setup coding scheme
  * Operationalize the variables
    * Clearly define all categories
  * Identify unit for coding 
  * Normally: 2 independent coders and a check is made for inter coder agreement (i.e. check for bias)

  * General terms
    * Participant (subject)
    * Independent variables (test conditions)
    * Dependent variables (what you measure)

  * If all participants try both drinks (within)
  * If half of the participants try one drink only (between)
  * We can also have a control group (D0 - water or no drink)
  * We can also have a mixed design (the length of the race could be a second condition and be between subjects, type of drink is within)   
 
<aside class='notes'>
Let's look at an example.
A sports drink company wants to test two types of drinks and their effect on racers.
Hence there will be different variables, such as:
if all participants try both drinks (within a specified time).
if half of the participants tryied one drink only.
and so on.

## Experimental design 

* **within** group design
  - each subject performs experiment under each condition
  - transfer of learning possible 
  - less costly and less likely to suffer from user variation
* **between** groups design 
  - each subject performs under only one condition 
  - no transfer of learning 
  - more users required
  - variation can bias results

  * So in the drinks example, a confound variable could be:
    * Temperature at the time of the race
    * Previous experience
    * Age of racers

#### Evaluation Method (what is the method used and summarize the **setup**)
* **Procedure:** the sequence of steps from welcoming participant to the    participant leaving the experiment room, in other words: you provide    enough detail on the process of data collection to allow another person to    repeat your research
* **Materials:** Here you describe the equipment/instruments used for data    collection (computers, microphones, screens, tangible objects, etc).
* **Setup:** where was the participant seated, how far from the screen, etc.
* **Measurements:** details on data collection instruments (what is being measured and how)
* **Participants:** Here you need to identify the units you studied (what types    of users).  When the research units are humans, they are most often    referred to as "participants."
