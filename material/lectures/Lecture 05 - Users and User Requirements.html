## Why do we need to Understand Users?
  * You are designing **for** users
  * Essential to have a clear idea of your target audience, as:
    - People vary
    - Physical abilities
    - Cognitive abilities   
 
<aside class='notes'>
Remember, you are designing for users.
Which means we need to understand their
Experience, 
Culture,
Knowledge,
and
Attitudes
if you want to design a successful interface.

### What is cognition?
## A bit of psychology   

* It is what goes on in our heads when we carry out our    everyday **activities**   

<img src='.\images\lec06Slide5-4.png'

<aside class='notes'>
Cognition is a term referring to the mental processes involved in gaining knowledge and comprehension. 
These cognitive processes include thinking, knowing, remembering, judging, and problem-solving.
Hence people use their cognitive processes when they interacting with interfaces.
</aside>

<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
## Some core aspects of cognition   
  * **Attention**: What to concentrate on, what we take in 
  * **Perception**: How information is acquired from the    world and transformed into experiences
  * **Memory**: What we can bring back to mind
  * **Reading, speaking, listening**: Understanding words    and language
  * **Problem-solving**, planning, learning, reasoning,    decision-making   

### All have implications for design   

 
<aside class='notes'>
Of course, cognition is a broad subject.
You could do an entire course just on cognition.
However, the  core aspects that are important for interaction design include attention, perception, memory, communication and finally problem solving.
All of these aspects have implications for the design.

### 1. Attention
#### What we concentrate on and what we take in

<aside class='notes'>
Examples of auditory attention.
 Such as listening for your name to be called in a doctor's office.
Another example, is your visual attention - such as, scanning the football results as they appear online via a live feed.
Attention allows us to focus on information that is relevant to what we are doing.

Something draws your attention - as you might know exactly what we want (e.g. finding out who won Wimbledon)
or you might let our attention wander then take focus, e.g. perusing a menu.

## Activity Tullis

The activities shown earlier, Tullis (1987) found that the **two screens** produced quite **different results**
  
  * 1st screen - took an average of **5.5** seconds to search
  * 2nd screen - took **3.2** seconds to search 
<br><br>

### **Why was the second one faster?** 
   * Both displays have the same density of  information (31%)

<aside class='notes'>
Tullis in a study back in 1987 explored this problem.
He investigated why the second display helped people find information faster.
Both displays have the same density of information.
So why is it easier for users to find things faster on the second display?
What is the exact reason?
</aside>
 
</textarea>
</section>
 
 
<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
#### Activity Tullis (Cont)

  ## **Spacing** is the Reason
   
  * In the 1st screen the information is **bunched up** together, making it    hard to search search for what their attention is focussed on
  *  In the 2nd screen the characters are grouped into **vertical categories**    of information making it easier   
 
<aside class='notes'>
In answer to the question.
The reason was spacing. 
Bunching up information makes it difficult to extract and search.
While categorising and spacing out information into groups made it easer for the reader.

<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
## Attention Key Points   
  * Influenced by our **own** goals and interests how information is presented
  * Implications for interaction design:
    - Help direct the user's attention
  * Present (only) the information that is needed right now
  * Highlight what is most relevant
  * Use techniques that make things stand out like colour, ordering,    spacing, underlining, sequencing and animation 
  * **Leave out clutter**
  * **Group** related information together   

 
<aside class='notes'>
Hopefully, based on the previous activity you should be able to see the importance of understanding how our attention works and how it influences the design process.
Know exactly what you want the design to do - try to match this with the information available.
For example, leave out clutter and group relevant information together.

## Activity Insights
   
  Weller (2004) found people took less time to    locate items for information that was **grouped**    using a **border** (2nd screen) **compared** with using    **colour** contrast (1st screen)   
  
<aside class='notes'>
 As illustrated in previous example, grouping items together and being spaces between them can aid attention
designers.
Spacing and bordering content into groups is better than contrasting with colour.

## **Perception** Key Points   
 * It is important to present information in a way that can be **readily perceived** in the manner intended
 * Design **implications**
 * Help the user pick things up easily
 * Use **icons and graphics** that are **clear** and **easy** to understand
 * Use **borders and spacing** to indicate grouping
 * Spoken words should be clear and audible
 * **Text and background** should contrast, clear fonts, large    enough, text legible   

 
<aside class='notes'>
 
</aside>
In summary, when taking perception into the design considerations. ensure the information is presented in a way that is beneficial to the manner it was intended.

## 3. Memory 
  * Recalling various kinds of **knowledge** that    allow us to act appropriately
  * Recall vs recognition   
   
<img src='.\images\lec06Slide18-4.png' 
 style = '
   border:0;
   width:80%;
   height:auto;

<aside class='notes'>
Memory is an important cognitive process that allows us to encode, store, and retrieve information. It is a critical component in the design process as we need to know what knowledge our users have.
Users will react and act differently if they are recalling versus learning the task or information.
</aside>
 
</textarea>
</section>
 
<!-- ----------------------------- -->
 
<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
## Recall vs recognition   
  * Bring something back to memory
    - Remember a telephone number or a password
  * Recognition
    - See/hear something and know what it is
    - See a picture and recognise the face; translate from a  foreign language into your own
    - **Recognition** is easier than recall   

 
<aside class='notes'>
Recognition refers to our ability to recognize an event or piece of information as being familiar, while recall designates the retrieval of related details from memory.
Importantly, recognition is easier than recall.
This can influence your choice, for example, if you are more familiar with something you are more likely to choose it.

## Activity   
  * Try to remember the **dates** of your grandparents' birthday
 
  * Try to remember the **cover** of the last app/game you bought/used   
  
<br>

#### Which is easiest? Why?   
  
<aside class='notes'>
As an example, try the following activities.
Use visual cues.
People are very good at remembering visual cues about things/
for example. the colour of items, the location of objects and marks on an object.
They find it more difficult to learn and remember arbitrary material .
Such as birthdays and phone numbers.

## **Memory** Key Points
  * **Design implications** to support memory
  * **Help** users quickly recall or recognise
  * Keep procedures short and simple
  * **Menus and Icons** use recognition, commands use **recall**
    - Menus and icons are easier than commands
  * Use **common and familiar** icons and commands,    place consistently
  * Small number of options
    - especially for infrequent users  
  * cont.

<aside class='notes'>
Looking at memory you should keep in mind that the user should find your interaction easy.
Hence you want to keep procedures and options short and simple.
Don't overload the user.
They have limited memory.
</aside>

<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
#### Memory Key Points(cont)
### Design implications to **support memory**
  * Offer **hints** to promote memory
    - tool-tips, auto-complete, questions
  * Offer different ways for people to organise    information - colour, time stamp, categories - so    they can remember where things are
  * Offer **search facilities** so we don't have to    remember where we put things!   

<img src='.\images\lec06Slide22-4.png' 
 style = '
   border:0;
   width:90%;
   height:auto;
' >
 
<aside class='notes'>
Try and make your interface memory friendly.
Offer hints and help if necessary.
Examples include google mail's delete button.
The delete button is a trash can.
Hopefully, you can relate to what a trash can will do.
It means delete. 
So it is easy for the users to find and understand.

### 4. Language: reading, speaking and listening   
  * It takes cognitive effort to processing words - **written or spoken**
  * Reading takes more skill than listening
  * However, reading is quick easy to skip and review   

<img src='.\images\lec06Slide23-4.png' 
 style = '
   border:0;
   width:60%;
   height:auto;
' >
 
<aside class='notes'>
You have to think of how you will communicate information.
What language will you use.
How will you communicate this information.
Will you use pictures, words or sounds.
How much information are you going to communicate.
Are you going to allow users to skip or skim over text. 
Reading takes more skill than listening - but it is easy to skim and skip pages.
</aside>
 
</textarea>
</section>
 

 
<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
### 4. Language: reading, speaking and listening Key Points
  * **Writing**
    - permanent, 
    - grammatical unless 'messy' speech
  * **Listening** 
    - transient
    - needs recall
	
<br>
<br>

##### Different **individuals vary** and have different    **cognitive styles** - some prefer verbal, visual  (object/spatial)  

 
<aside class='notes'>
Writing is a permanent means of communicating information.
While listening is more of a transient process using recall.

##### Problem-solving, planning, reasoning and decision-making    
  * All involves **reflective cognition**
    - e.g. thinking about what to do, what the options    are, and the consequences

### Problem-solving, planning, reasoning and decision-making    
  * Often involves **conscious processes**, discussion with others (or oneself), and the use of artefacts 
    - e.g. internet search, books, pen and paper

When you are involved in problem solving, you are conscious of the process. 
You are aware of others, yourself and any artefacts or items. 
For example, when you use a book or the internet.

### Problem-solving, planning, reasoning and decision-making    
  * **Reasoning**: May involve working through different    scenarios and deciding which is best option

## How do we **make decisions**?  
  * Exhaustively go through **all the possibilities**    (von Newmann and Morgenstern, 1944) or 
  * Get by with **just enough** information using  simple heuristics (Gigerenzer et al., 1999)    

<img src='.\images\lec06Slide30-4.png'

<aside class='notes'>
Let us look at how you make a decision.
Take the supermarket. 
In the supermarket you make decisions on what is in front of you, and what labels you recognise.

You then reflection on what you think you are doing. 

Consciously, you look ahead and think about the effects of your decisions.
You may also use external representations, such as, lists, maps, plans, or diagrams.

But you often use simple heuristics to make your decisions - especially if you are overloaded with information.

<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
#### Problem solving, planning, decision making, reasoning Key Points    
### **Design implications**
  * Provide additional (hidden)    information/functions for users who wish to    understand more about **how to carry out an    activity** more effectively (e.g. web searching)
  * Use **simple and memorable functions** at the    interface for computational aids to support    rapid decision-making and planning, e.g.    for users on the move.   

 
<aside class='notes'>
Developing an efficient and effective design is important.
You try and limit the information and choices.
Help users name rapid decision.
They do not need to ponder for large amounts of time each time they want to make a choice. 

The concept of decision support systems is large field of research and development.

#### Mental models
## Definitions   
  * "Mental models are **psychological representations**    of real, hypothetical, or imaginary situations."
    - Princeton Mental Models and Reasoning Lab
  *  "In **interacting with the environment**, with others,    and with the artefacts of technology, people form    internal, mental models of themselves and of the    things with which they are interacting. These    **models provide** predictive and explanatory power    for **understanding the interaction**."
    - Norman (in Gentner & Stevens, 1983)   
  
<aside class='notes'>
Mental models are **psychological representations**.
Large amount of research on the subject over the years.
Mental models provide predictive and explanatory power to help us understanding the interaction between users and the artefact.

Mental Models, in cognitive theory provide, one view on how humans reason eitherÿ (Johnson-Laird, 1989):
Functionally, i.e. understanding what the system can do
or structurally, i.e. understanding how it works.

What the user believes they know about a system strongly impactsÿ(Nielson):
whether they use it,
whether they trust it,
how they use it.

Getting it wrong can cause harm/upset

Humans typically over estimate what a system can do and this means heightened level of initial trust- 
get in a car- trust the GPS; go to a shopping website- trust it

What the user believes about the system at hand (Nielson)
Designers need to make a user interface communicate the system's basic nature well enough that users form reasonably accurate (and thus useful) mental models

## **TRUST** and Mental models   **STUDY**   
  * Subjects with a **High Fidelity Mental Model** have more appropriate amount of    trust 
  * People tend to distrust systems that they don't understand (Wang et al, 2016)

Novice users- panic and untrust when system doing autonomous but reasonable behaviour.

have trust levels that are less sensitive to autonomous (but reasonable) behaviour.

  * Exploration
  * **Metaphors**
  * Mental models are often incomplete or wrong
  * Mental models influence if used and how    (Neilson)   

 
<aside class='notes'>
How do we form mental models?
Our mental models are formed based on our experience, training and exploration.
Mental models are often incomplete or wrong and influence our interaction with systems.

## Mental v. Conceptual models   
  * Mental models are formed **during** interaction
  * Represent the user's understanding of how the system works and what it can do
  * **Influenced** by the **conceptual model**   
 
 
<aside class='notes'>
Interestingly mental models are formed during interaction.
And represent the user's understanding of how the system works and what it can do.
The mental model is also influenced by the conceptual model.

## Mental v. Conceptual models   
  * Conceptual models (e.g. the    desktop) help users learn/recall    how to operate a system - can    assist understanding of what it    can do
  * They do not necessarily describe    how the underlying system    actually works

## Mental models   
  * A mental model is an explanation in someone's    thought process for how something works in    the real world 
  * It is a kind of internal symbol or representation    of external reality, hypothesised to play a    major role in cognition and decision-making

Let's talk about users.
As they are central to our design.

## People vary!   
  * User Characteristics are part of the **Problem Space**
  * Cognitive **abilities** can vary - e.g. memory
  * Educational background, age, culture and nationality,    age, physical abilities, attitude to computers
  * System use
  * Novice or expert users
  * Frequent or casual users
 
<br>
 
#### All have **design implications** that affect User    Experience and Usability of our design   
  
<aside class='notes'>
The first thing you need to remember is that people are not all the same. 
People vary.

### What are the users' **capabilities**?   
  * Humans vary in many dimensions:
    - **size of hands** may affect the size and positioning of    input buttons 
    - **motor abilities** may affect the suitability of certain    input and output devices 
    - **height** if designing a physical kiosk 
    - **strength** - a child's toy requires little strength to    operate, but greater strength to change batteries
    - **sight**, hearing, dexterity, memory

### Design for **different** user characteristics   
  * **Old vs young**
    - Older users - poorer eyesight, larger icons and text,    clearer fonts
  * **Expert vs Novice**
    - Novices - needs prompting, fewer options, clarity
    - Experts - needs flexibility, access to functions, power
  * **Frequent vs casual use**
    - Frequent users - prefer short cuts for speed
    - Casual/infrequent users
  * Clear paths to the goal    

 
<aside class='notes'>
You have to remember the range of user characteristics.
From old and young to expert and novice users.
Each of these characteristics plays an important part in your design.

  ## User profiles   
  * Capture characteristics for a single user or a typical    profile for a group of similar users
  * Include imperfections and profile should be relevant to    how people interact with the limits to user's    capabilities, not just ideal users
    - E.g. for a teaching system: 
      - one profile for a student and one for a teacher
      - might need more profiles for different types of student

# Personas   
  * Capture user characteristics
  * Imaginary people, but synthesised from real users
  * Should be realistic - like the people who will use    your system, not perfect people
  * Designers often develop a small set of different    personas with one primary one

#### User Requirements   
 ### Now that you've thought of who    your users are
  * What are their requirements?
  * **WHAT** the system should do
  * Not **HOW** the system should do    it

#### Requirements can include   
  * **Diagrams** of how the system will operate or    be used 
  * **Scenarios** or interview transcripts
  * Humans respond well to **narrative** 
  * Show the **sequence of events**
  * Mathematically formal descriptions (e.g.    formal spec)
  * Descriptions designed for different    readerships

### Types of Requirements   
  * **Functional** Requirements (F)
    - Services provided
    - 'What' NOT 'How'
  * **Non-Functional** Requirements (NF)
    - Constraints such as running on certain    platforms, conforming to standards.
    - Attributes such as appearance, usability
    - 'Quality Attributes'

<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
## Non-Functional Requirements   
  * NOT concerned with specific system    'functionality'
  * Rather they specify the system's 'quality    characteristics' or 'quality attributes'
  * Applies constraints to what  system should and    shouldn't do

## **Non-functional** Requirements   
### Often deal with 

 * **Emergent properties**
   -  properties of the whole system (availability,    security, performance) 
   - performance, organisational or external issues
 * For instance: usability, reliability, security,    standards to comply with, programming    languages, legal issues, etc.

#### Functional/Non-Functional?   
### Website administrators should be able to add, alter or edit    personal detail
 
 * The system should run under the version of Linux that is    currently installed in the lab 
 * The robot should respond in 2 seconds   (NF)
 * The robot should be able to communicate with the user using    speech 
 * The robot speech should be clear and understandable to the    user
 * Language used should be adapted to the user

### Writing Requirements   
  * The services and functions expected of the system
  * The user must/could/should be able to <verb> .
  * The system should/could/must be able to do <verb> for the user 
  * Be as specific as possible
  * Should be testable/measurable
  * **Avoid vague sayings**
    - E.g. the system should be usable (OF COURSE!)
  * Rather: A customer service rep should be able to enter 3 issues in less than    15 minutes
  * They should be complete and consistent
  * This  may be difficult w/r large systems with many stakeholders (e.g.    different priorities)
  * Talk to your users! Developers don't have domain specific knowledge

### Prioritising Requirements   
  * Use notation and numbering 
  * Example:
  * F-UR 1 Allow the user to record details of patients and access patient records
  * Priority : Essential, Source : Dr Brown 
  * F-UR 1-1 Add a new patient. 
  * The user shall be able to add details of a new patient to the system. This will    include personal details, known clinical factors, and radiological    morphology. A complete list of fields to be included and their permitted    values is given in Appendix A. 
  * F-UR 1-2 View patient details. 
  * The user shall be able to search for patient records by Surname. Patients    can be further identified by date of birth. All details held for the selected    patient shall then be displayed.
