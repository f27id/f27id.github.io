# Human-AI Interaction in the light of Design  \n Principles \n 
  * Intelligent user interfaces can violate number of design principles or  \n usability guidelines
  * Such as consistency, feedback.
  * Consistency refers to minimizing unexpected changes with a consistent  \n interface appearance and predictable behavior,
  * However AI systems tend to be inconsistent due to poorly understood probabilistic  \n behaviors
  * Feedback refers to providing user with information about the results of an  \n action,
  * However Intelligent user interfaces can react differently due to senor noise or  \n lighting effects.
  * E.g. auto-completing systems suggesting different words after language model  \n updates, search-engine returning different results due to personalization.

# Design & Deliver!	 \n 
  * Human-AI Interaction systems are an on-going research area
  * The delivery of these systems needs a lot of testing and feedback
 
 * Therefore, It is also important to understand guidelines for designing  \n and delivering Human-AI interaction Systems. \n

# Guidelines (Gs) \n 
  * Guidelines and principles for designing user interfaces are studied in  \n Interaction Design.
 
 * However!!!
  
 * Due to the variability of AI designs (capabilities and interaction styles),
 * and high-reports of failures (autocomplete errors)
  
 * There is need to study guidelines for designing Human-AI interactions.

<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
# Guidelines (Gs) \n 
  * G1 - Make Clear what the system can do
 \n Help the user understand what the AI system is capable of doing
 \n 
 \n Example applications
 \n [Activity Trackers] "Displays all the metrics that it tracks and explains how.  \n Metrics include movement metrics such as steps, distance travelled, length of  \n time exercised, and all-day calorie burn, for a day." 
 \n Example violation
 \n [Social Networks] "This guideline is violated because I cannot even tell what  \n this news feed can/will show." \n 

 
<aside class='notes'>
 
 </aside>
 
</textarea>
</section>
 
 
 
<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
#\ G2 - Make clear how well the system can do what it can do. 
 * Help the user understand how often the AI system may make mistakes. 
 \n 
 \n Example application 
 \n [Music Recommenders] "A little bit of hedging language: 'we think you'll like'." 
 \n 
 \n Example Violation
 \n [Social Networks] "For some of the ads, there is a 'suggested post' on the top  \n to indicate that this is just a suggestion. But for the rest of the posts, there is  \n no clue for me to tell the quality. 
 \n 

 
<aside class='notes'>
 
 </aside>
 
</textarea>
</section>
 
 
 
<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>

 ## G3 - Time services based on context. 
 
 * Time when to act or interrupt based on the user's current task and  \n environment. 
 \n 
 \n Example application 
 \n [Social Networks] "If the user has not accessed [the product] in a while, the  \n application will let the user know that there is something new to be explored  \n - a story, video. 
 \n Example violations: 
 \n [Email] "Sending notifications for unimportant messages likely something  \n most people will not want as an interruption." 
 \n 

 
<aside class='notes'>
 Voice Assistants "There is no indication of when [the assistant] will actually remind you of the set reminder. She just confirms that the reminder has been set  (mind you this I regardless if you have this Reminders app downloaded or not)." 

 </aside>
 
</textarea>
</section>
 
 
 
<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
## G4 - Show contextually relevant information. 
 
 * Display information relevant to the user's current task and environment. 
 \n 
 \n Example applications 
 \n [Web Search] "Searching a movie title returns show times in near my location  \n for today's date" 
 \n Example Violation
 \n [Email] "What goes into the [tabs] is the same all the time. It does not change  \n based on the context, for example to...emails related to the meeting I'm  \n attending or the message I'm reading." 
 \n 
 \n 
 \n 
 
<aside class='notes'>
 
 </aside>
 
</textarea>
</section>
 
 
 
<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
## G5 - Match relevant social norms. 
 * Ensure the experience is delivered in a way that users would expect, given  \n their social and cultural context. 
 \n 
 \n Example application
 \n [Voice Assistants] "[The assistant] uses a semi- formal voice to talk to you -  \n spells out "okay" and asks further questions." 
 \n Example Violation
 \n [Email] "the system does not follow the social norms of a workplace. For  \n example, one norm is to pay attention to your manager. However, even with  \n access to company hierarchies, it isn't clear that the system will put messages  \n from one's direct manager in the [appropriate tab] automatically." 
 \n 

 
<aside class='notes'>
 
 </aside>
 
</textarea>
</section>
 
 
 
<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
## G6 - Mitigate social biases.  
 * Ensure the AI system's language and behaviors do not rein- force undesirable  \n and unfair stereotypes and biases. 
 \n 
 \n Example Application 
 \n [Autocomplete] "The autocomplete feature clearly suggests both genders  \n [him, her] without any bias while suggesting the text to complete." 
 \n 
 \n Example violation 
 \n [Voice Assistants] "When asked "...can you change your voice" [the assistant]  \n responds in a male voice saying "Here is an example of my other voice. Would  \n you like me to use this one?"... While it's nice that a male voice is given as an  \n option, the default...voice is female, which reinforces stereotypical gender  \n roles that presume a secretary or receptionist is female." 
 \n

<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
## G7 - Support efficient invocation. 
 * Make it easy to invoke or request the AI system's services when needed. 
 \n 
 \n Example Application 
 \n [Voice Assistants] "I can say [wake command] to initiate." 
 \n 
 \n Example violation: 
 \n [Navigation] "[The product] remembers where you parked your car. However  \n if it fails to remember, or I want it to remember something else (e.g., where I  \n chained up my bike), it is not possible (or at least not easily discov- erable) to  \n invoke the capability when I need it." 
 \n 
 \n 

 
<aside class='notes'>

</textarea>
</section>
 
 
 
<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
## G8 - Support efficient dismissal. 
 * Make it easy to dismiss or ignore undesired AI system ser- vices. 
 \n 
 \n Example Application 
 \n [E-commerce] "Feature is unobtrusive, below the fold, and easy to scroll  \n past...Easy to ignore." 
 \n Example Violation
 \n [Navigation] "Suggested locations based on calendar entries can't be removed  \n from the suggestions." 
 \n 
 \n 
 \n 

 
<aside class='notes'>
 
 </aside>
 
</textarea>
</section>
 
 
 
<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
## G9 - Support efficient correction. 
 * Make it easy to edit, refine, or recover when the AI system is wrong. 
 \n 
 \n Example Application
 \n [Voice Assistants] "Once my request for a reminder was processed, I saw the  \n ability to edit my reminder in the UI that was displayed. Small text  \n underneath stated 'Tap to Edit' with a chevron indicating something would  \n happen if I selected this text." 
 \n Example Violation
 \n [E-commerce] "I already recently bought the items which are in my  \n recommendation list & there is no message to discontinue nor option for  \n users to deselect." 
 \n 
 \n 
 \n 

 
<aside class='notes'>
 
 </aside>
 
</textarea>
</section>
 
 
 
<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
## G10 - Scope services when in doubt. 
 * Engage in disambiguation or gracefully degrade the AI system's services when  \n uncertain about a user's goals. 
 \n 
 \n Example applications: 
 \n [Navigation] "If more than one line takes the same route the user can choose  \n between the preferred line." 
 \n 
 \n Example violations: 
 \n [Music Recommenders] "The system doesn't ask for user input about its  \n recommendations, nor does it provide a way for users to provide input." 
 \n 
 \n 
 \n 

 
<aside class='notes'>
 
 </aside>
 
</textarea>
</section>
 
 
 
<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
## G11 - Make clear why the system did what it did. 
 * Enable the user to access an explanation of why the AI system behaved as it  \n did. 
 \n 
 \n Example applications: 
 \n [E-commerce] "Clicking "Why recommended" explains why they have  \n recommended that particular item to you."
 \n 
 \n Example violations: 
 \n [Music Recommenders] "The system provides no information about why the  \n recommended songs/artists are chosen." 
 \n 
 \n 

<aside class='notes'>
 
 </aside>
 
</textarea>
</section>
 
 
 
<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
## G12 - Remember recent interactions. 
 * Maintain short term memory and allow the user to make efficient references  \n to that memory. 
 \n 
 \n Example applications: 
 \n [Navigation] "Opening the app shows a list of recent destinations, as well as  \n allows you to access "favorite" locations." 
 \n 
 \n Example violations: 
 \n [Social Networks] "This guideline is violated since there is no indication of  \n "what you have read" 
 \n 

 
<aside class='notes'>
 
 </aside>
 
</textarea>
</section>
 
 
 
<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
## G13 - Learn from user behavior. 
 * Personalize the user's experience by learning from their ac- tions over time. 
 \n 
 \n Example applications: 
 \n [Music Recommenders] "I think this is applied because every action to add a  \n song to the list triggers new recommendations." \
 \n 
 \n Example violations: 
 \n [Activity Trackers] "The app notifies/nudges users to push them to achieve  \n goals, but I haven't seen a change in behavior even though my patterns have  \n changed."  \n 

 
<aside class='notes'>
 
 </aside>
 
</textarea>
</section>
 
 
 
<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
## G14 - Update and adapt cautiously. 
 * Limit disruptive changes when updating and adapting the AI system's  \n behaviors. 
 \n 
 \n Example applications: 
 \n [Music Recommenders] "Once we select a song they update the immediate  \n song list below but keeps the above one constant." 
 \n 
 \n Example violation
 \n [Social Networks] "If I'm in the middle of watching a video post, every now  \n and then they will scroll me up to the first post." 
 \n 
 \n 

 
<aside class='notes'>
 
 </aside>
 
</textarea>
</section>
 
 
 
<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
## G15 - Encourage granular feedback. 
 * Enable the user to provide feedback indicating their prefer- ences during  \n regular interaction with the AI system 
 \n 
 \n Example application
 \n [Social Networks] "[The product] allows the user to "Hide an Ad," and then  \n when doing so, solicits feedback to improve relevancy of future ads." 
 \n 
 \n Example violations: 
 \n [Voice Assistants] "Once [the assistant] performed the task I had asked of it,  \n there was no additional ability to customize the experience or give feedback  \n on my satisfaction; even when I chose to remove the reminder right after I  \n verbally requested it."  \n 

 
<aside class='notes'>
 
 </aside>
 
</textarea>
</section>
 
 
 
<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
## G16 - Convey the consequences of user actions. 
 * Immediately update or convey how user actions will impact future behaviors  \n of the AI system. 
 \n 
 \n Example applications: 
 \n [MusicRecommenders] "Tapping thelike/dislike button results in immediate  \n popups informing that the user will receive more/fewer recommendations  \n like it." 
 \n 
 \n Example violations: 
 \n [Social Networks] "You can unfollow or like or interact but how that affects  \n you isn't clear. It just sort a happens." 
 \n 
 \n 

 
<aside class='notes'>
 
 </aside>
 
</textarea>
</section>
 
 
 
<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
## G17 - Provide global controls. 
 * Allow the user to globally customize what the AI system monitors and how it  \n behaves. 
 \n 
 \n Example applications: 
 \n [Web Search] "It has settings such as...private results that help users get  \n results that are more relevant to them." 
 \n 
 \n Example violations: 
 \n [Email] "The only option is to turn the system on or off. It otherwise applies to  \n all messages at all times. It is not clear how the system works, or what data it  \n monitors, but presumably it applies to entire email contents." 
 \n 

 
<aside class='notes'>
 
 </aside>
 
</textarea>
</section>
 
 
 
<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
## G18 - Notify users about changes. 
 * Inform the user when the AI system adds or updates its capabilities. 
 \n 
 \n Example applications: 
 \n [Email] "The help tab for the interface features a "What's new" section which  \n could be used to inform the user about AI system additions or capability  \n updates." 
 \n 
 \n Example violations: 
 \n [Music Recommenders] "The algorithm feels like it constantly updates, with a  \n slightly different feel to my recommendations every week. However there is  \n no explanation of what has changed." 
 \n
