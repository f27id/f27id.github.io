						* Why is Documentation Important?
						* What is a **Design Document**?
						* How to structure a report/design document?
						** What's important? motivation? references?
						* Questions and Discussion
						
<aside class='notes'>
Hello again!
 How is everyone. Today we are going to cover design documentation.
 In today's lecture we will discuss, what is a design document is.
We will begin by explaining why you should document your designs, and why this is important, that is, what's the motivation for a design document (and what should it contain).
We will also mention some of the tools and resources for searching for information on a topic.

## **What** is a Design Document?    
<aside class='notes'>
Let's begin by asking, what you think a design document is?
Some of you will have heard of this before, others this will be the first time, so let's review exactly what is a design document? 
</aside>

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->
 
<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
## **What** is a Design Document?   
  * Explanation of design
  * Limitations, functionality, tests, ..
    -  may also provide an account of differences between other products/tests 
  * What relevant data is available?
  * Extra information on the design:
    - Where are the gaps and opportunities?

#### Why is Documentation Important?  
## Provides detail for: 
  * Help other people understand your design
    - not just about you!
  * What might have **changed** since previous research was done (track revisions, history, updates)
  * What do we **already know**? What are the contradictions? What do we still not know?   Is the existing research flawed? What have they missed? 
  * Literature review can provide new knowledge
  * Present **trends**, analysis

#### Design Documentation (Nutshell)
## Provides detail for: 
  * Design documentation is a **collection of documents** and **resources** that covers **all aspects** of your design
  * Include information about **users**, product **features**, and project **deadlines**; 
    - all essential implementation details; and design decisions

## Referencing   /Citation

### The **Purpose** of **Referencing**

  * **Acknowledging** the research/words/ideas of others 
  * **Demonstrating** you have read widely 
  * Providing **evidence** for backing up your claims/ viewpoint 
  * There are many different ways of citing resources from research.
  * The citation style sometimes depends on the academic discipline involved. The **Harvard System** (aka Author-Date) is our School's preferred style   
 
<aside class='notes'>
 Referencing and Citations are an important part of the literature review.
 The citation and referencing is a way of giving credit to individuals for their creative and intellectual works that you utilized to support your research. It acknowledges the research work and ideas of others.
 It demonstrates that you have researched and read work by other researchers.
 You provide evidence to backup your claims or viewpoint. 
 There are many different ways of citing resources from research for example A P A , Vancourver, I triple E, and Harvard. 
 The citation style sometimes depends on the academic discipline involved. Our school's preferred style is Harvard.

## **How** can I find/retrieve literature? 
  * **Google Scholar**
    - keywords important, use advanced scholar
	- scholar.google.com

 How do we find and retrieve literature. 
 We discussed earlier, that searching articles is an important part of the literature review.
 Here, we will discuss, how to find and retrieve literature.
 It is important to search using relevant keywords

## Advanced Search

 style = '

<aside class='notes'>
 Using Google scholar.
 It is important to use relevant and specific keywords. You can use google scholar standard search to find most of the relevant articles.
 You can also use Advanced search filters to narrow down your search. For example if you search for robots, you will a number of articles related to robot research in your search results.

<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
## What is a **credible** source? 
  * **Authority**: what are the authors credentials? What type of site? 
    - Is the content **peer reviewed**? 
  * **Accuracy**: are the facts verifiable? References included? 
  * **Objectivity**: is it fact, opinion or propaganda? is it up-to-date? Is the date indicated?
  * Who else cites the work? How many times?
  * Wikipedia is **not authentic**, neither are blogs, or youtube links
 
 
<aside class='notes'>
 At this point you now how to perform search using different sources including Google scholar, Microsoft academic. 
 Now when you have the research results, how do you filter through the good and relevant articles. There are a number of parameters to consider.
 First you check the Authority. what are the authors credentials? What type of site? Is the content of article peer reviewed? 
 Second, you check Accuracy. are the facts verifiable. Are the facts justified with sufficient References. 
 Third is Objectivity. Does the article state facts, opinion or propaganda. Is the work up-to-date. Is the date of research and publication indicated.
 Fourth and important is, how many other researchers have cited the work.The higher the number of citations, the better. For example if an article is cited by 1000 researchers, it means, the work is important.
 Remember that Wikipedia is not an authentic, neither are blogs, or youtube links.

## How can I find/retrieve literature (other than Google scholar) 
  * Publisher websites
  * **ACM, IEEE, Springer**
  * Journal catalogues
  * Subscription can be an issue
  * Go through library website
  * Go through Google scholar (tries to get the PDF)
  * At home use the **library proxy**
    - https://scholar.google.es/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_humancomputerinteraction 
 
<aside class='notes'>
 Lets discuss searching for literature sources other than Google scholar.
 There are a number of sources and some of them are discussed on earlier slides.
 The sources include Publisher websites, Journals catalogues, A C M , I triple E, Springer, Scopus etc. 
 You could go through the University's library website to access these resources for free as some of the sources are subcription based and may require access fee.
