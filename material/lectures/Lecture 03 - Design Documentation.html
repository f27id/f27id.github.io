						* Why is Documentation Important?
						* What is a **Design Document**?
						* How to structure a report/design document?
						** What's important? motivation? references?
						* Questions and Discussion
						
<aside class='notes'>
Hello again!
 How is everyone. Today we are going to cover design documentation.
 In today's lecture we will discuss, what is a design document is.
We will begin by explaining why you should document your designs, and why this is important, that is, what's the motivation for a design document (and what should it contain).
We will then go through the structure of a standard report with details on benchmarking and statements.

## **What** is a Design Document?    
<aside class='notes'>
Let's begin by asking, what you think a design document is?
Some of you will have heard of this before, others this will be the first time, so let's review exactly what is a design document? 
</aside>

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->
 
<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
## **What** is a Design Document?   
  * Explanation of design
  * Limitations, functionality, tests, ..
    -  may also provide an account of differences between other products/tests 
  * What relevant data is available?
  * Extra information on the design:
    - Where are the gaps and opportunities?

#### Why is Documentation Important?  
## Helps to find out: 
  * Help other people understand your design
    - not just about you!
  * What might have **changed** since previous research was done 
  * What do we **already know**? What are the contradictions? What do we still not know?   Is the existing research flawed? What have they missed? 
  * Literature review can provide new knowledge
  * Present **trends**, analysis

## Referencing   /Citation

### The **Purpose** of **Referencing**

  * **Acknowledging** the research/words/ideas of others 
  * **Demonstrating** you have read widely 
  * Providing **evidence** for backing up your claims/ viewpoint 
  * There are many different ways of citing resources from research.
  * The citation style sometimes depends on the academic discipline involved. The **Harvard System** (aka Author-Date) is our School's preferred style   
 
<aside class='notes'>
 Referencing and Citations are an important part of the literature review.
 The citation and referencing is a way of giving credit to individuals for their creative and intellectual works that you utilized to support your research. It acknowledges the research work and ideas of others.
 It demonstrates that you have researched and read work by other researchers.
 You provide evidence to backup your claims or viewpoint. 
 There are many different ways of citing resources from research for example A P A , Vancourver, I triple E, and Harvard. 
 The citation style sometimes depends on the academic discipline involved. Our school's preferred style is Harvard.
</aside>
 
</textarea>
</section>
 
 
 
<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
## **Examples** of Harvard Style   

  * Source information always appears in **two places**: 
    1. In-text (part of a sentence)
    2. In the reference list (at the end)
  * The **in-text** reference (Author's Surname Year, page) must    **match exactly** the full reference in the **reference section**: 
    - An in-text a reference looks like this: 
```html
Action Research is 'reflective research practice' (Cherry 1999,p.17)
```
  * The reader then looks for 'Cherry 1999' in the reference list where it looks like this: 
```html
Cherry, N., 1999. Action Research: A Pathway to Action,    
Knowledge and Learning, RMIT University Press, Melbourne. 
```
  
<aside class='notes'>
 Let's have a look at some examples of Harvard style of citation.
 To reference work from other researchers in your work, information about any one source must always appear in two places.
 First, it should appear in the text (part of sentence) and second, it should appear in the reference list.
 You can see examples of Harvard Style on the slide.
 The in text citation should have Author's name, year of publication and page number if needed. It must match the full reference in the reference list.
 For example, see point number 5 on the slide. Action research is reflective research practice and look the reference starts with bracket author name, year of publication and page number. ( Cherry 1999, page 17)
 You can see the reference for this should appear in the reference list as shown in the bottom of the slide.

<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
## **Why** Harvard style?
  * Every institution, conference,  venue has its format
  * Will I have to manually edit my references every time? 
    - You can, but it is time consuming
  * We recommend you use citation tools, such as, "EndNote"

<aside class='notes'>
 Now lets discuss the reason for using Harvard style.
 The citation style sometimes depends on the academic discipline involved. Researchers from different disciplines prefer different citation styles.
 Harvard is our school's preferred citation style.
 The key questions is, how do I create and edit the references.
 You can do it manually in MS word, but it is too time consuming.
 We recommend to use EndNote software for referecing.

## **How** can I find/retrieve literature? 
  * **Google Scholar**
    - keywords important, use advanced scholar
	- scholar.google.com

<aside class='notes'>
 How do we find and retrieve literature. 
 We discussed earlier, that searching articles is an important part of the literature review.
 Here, we will discuss, how to find and retrieve literature.
 It is important to search using relevant keywords

 style = '

   width:800px;
   height:auto;
' >
 
<aside class='notes'>
 Using Google scholar.
 It is important to use relevant and specific keywords. You can use google scholar standard search to find most of the relevant articles.
 You can also use Advanced search filters to narrow down your search. For example if you search for robots, you will a number of articles related to robot research in your search results.

## What is a **credible** source? 
  * **Authority**: what are the authors credentials? What type of site? 
    - Is the content **peer reviewed**? 
  * **Accuracy**: are the facts verifiable? References included? 
  * **Objectivity**: is it fact, opinion or propaganda? is it up-to-date? Is the date indicated?
  * Who else cites the work? How many times?
  * Wikipedia is **not authentic**, neither are blogs, or youtube links
 
 
<aside class='notes'>
 At this point you now how to perform search using different sources including Google scholar, Microsoft academic. 
 Now when you have the research results, how do you filter through the good and relevant articles. There are a number of parameters to consider.
 First you check the Authority. what are the authors credentials? What type of site? Is the content of article peer reviewed? 
 Second, you check Accuracy. are the facts verifiable. Are the facts justified with sufficient References. 
 Third is Objectivity. Does the article state facts, opinion or propaganda. Is the work up-to-date. Is the date of research and publication indicated.
 Fourth and important is, how many other researchers have cited the work.The higher the number of citations, the better. For example if an article is cited by 1000 researchers, it means, the work is important.
 Remember that Wikipedia is not an authentic, neither are blogs, or youtube links.

## How can I find/retrieve literature (other than    Google scholar) 
  * Publisher websites
  * **ACM, IEEE, Springer**
  * Journal catalogues
  * Subscription can be an issue
  * Go through library website
  * Go through Google scholar (tries to get the PDF)
  * At home use the **library proxy**
    - https://scholar.google.es/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_humancomputerinteraction 
 
<aside class='notes'>
 Lets discuss searching for literature sources other than Google scholar.
 There are a number of sources and some of them are discussed on earlier slides.
 The sources include Publisher websites, Journals catalogues, A C M , I triple E, Springer, Scopus etc. 
 You could go through the University's library website to access these resources for free as some of the sources are subcription based and may require access fee.
