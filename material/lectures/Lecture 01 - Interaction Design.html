Today's lecture we'll talk about what is interactive design [pause]
We will then talk about approaches that are used to assess an interface (and quantify its effectiveness).
For example, using Norman's Design principles.
We will then work through a number of examples and conclude with some discussions on the topic.

	## What is Interaction Design?

<aside class='notes'>
Let's talk about what exactly interaction design is about.

## What is Interaction Design?
  * Designing interactive projects to support the way **people communicate** and interact in their everyday and working lives
  * Study of interaction between the users and interactive projects 
   - such as robots
   - remote control
   - microwaves
   - computers
   - mobile devices and so on
  * Basically, Interaction design goes **beyond Human-Computer Interaction** in terms of its scope
 
<aside class='notes'>
Interaction design is more than just interfaces. 
It is the design of interactive products and services and the way users will interact with them.
Interaction design is about understanding how people communicate and interact in their daily lives.
This can range from household appliances, such as, fridges and microwaves to more complex systems, like mobile phones and self-driving vehicles.
[pause]
Importantly! You should understand that interaction design is more than just human-computer interaction.

  Interaction design works with different disciplines and specializations.
  As shown in the figure there is a relationship among contributing academic disciplines, design practices, and interdisciplinary fields concerned with interaction design.
  Hence interaction design is ideally carried out by multidisciplinary teams. 
  From engineers and computer scientists to artists and psychologists.

## What do Interaction design Specialists do?
  * **Analyze** and **design** interactive products
  * Research Design and Evaluation
  * What is **user experience**?
    - improve satisfaction
    - usability
  
<img src='.\images\lec01Slide9-3.png'

<aside class='notes'>
 The key focus of Interactive design Specialists is the design of interactive product and the user experience. 
 The user experience refers to how a product behaves and how it is used by people in the real world. [pause]
 It is important to point out that one cannot design a user experience, only design for a
user experience. The aim is to improve user satisfaction, when using the product.

## Focus of Interaction Design
  * **User** centric topic
  * **Interdisciplinary** (e.g., psychology and anthropology)
  * **Iterative**
    - User research understand the user and his/her requirements
    - Conceptualize a design(low-fi)
    - Implement (high-fi) 
    - Evaluate (whenever necessary and go back)

<img src='.\images\lec01Slide12-3.png' 
 style = '

   height:auto;' >
<br>
 
<aside class='notes'>
 The focus of interaction design is: [pause]
 User Centric Design [pause] 
 Interdisciplinary, such as, Psychology and anthropology.
 The user centric design is an iterative process where you understand the user and their requirements. 
 After understanding requirements, you conceptualize the design using a proposed solution also known as a low-fi or low fidelity prototype.[pause]
 The next step is implementation or high fidelity prototype.
 In the last step you would perform an evaluation of the experiments. 
 If you found issues with the proposed design then you would go back to the start.
 Hence the iterative process.

<aside class='notes'>
Why is the user important?
See the design in the image. 
The left part of the image shows the designer thinking without involving users. 
On the right hand side, we see that users adopt what makes their life easier.
It is important to understand users in the contexts in which they live,
work, and learn.
It can help designers understand how to design interactive products
that provide a good user experiences or match a user's needs.

# How will you learn skills?
  * **Literature** reviews
  * Understanding users, usability and design thinking
  * Paper-based **prototyping**
  * Tool-based prototyping
  * Evaluations Methods
 
<aside class='notes'>
  How do we learn the skills do develop a successful solution?
  It is important to note that during this course you will conduct literature reviews of articles relating to interaction design. We will discuss this in the coming weeks.
  As discussed in the previous slides, understanding users is fundamental to interaction design.
  Usability and design thinking is essential for creating better design and good interactive systems.
  Prototyping is another important aspect of the design process. We will discuss the details of this in the coming weeks. 
  Once you have developed a prototype, the final step is evaluation. 
  But before that you need to understand the process and important evaluation methods.

  Not all designs are equal.
  We are surrounded by both good and poor designs. 
  The bad designs are non-intuitive and non-ergonomics with poor aesthetics. 
  These are not user friendly and can be confusing and have poor usability. 
  Good design, however, must take the users focus and provide a good experience and user satisfaction.[pause]

# Affordances
  
  " A situation where an object's sensory characteristics **intuitively imply** its functionality and use

   border:0;
   text-align: center;
   width:430.057px;
   height:439.1998px;
' >
 
<aside class='notes'>
  What is Affordance? [pause]
  This is a term used to refer to an attribute of an object that allows people to know how to
  use it. For example, a mouse button invites pushing by the way it is physically constrained in its plastic shell. [pause]
  At a simple level, to afford means to give a clue.[pause]
  
</aside>
 
</textarea>
</section>
 
 
 
<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
# Visual Affordances
  * Software interfaces are virtual and don't have a physical affordance
  * Rather **perceived affordance**

   height:139px;
' >
 
<aside class='notes'>
  What are Affordances Types? [pause]
  There are two types of affordances i.e. Perceived and Physical affordance. 
  Software interfaces are virtual and don't have physical affordance rather perceived affordance e.g. button, scrollbar etc.
  When the affordances of a physical object are perceptually obvious, it is easy to know how to interact with it. For example, a door handle affords pulling, a cup
handle affords grasping, and a mouse button affords pushing.

# Constraints
  * Reduce the number of possible actions
  * Avoid selection of invalid options
  
<img src='.\images\lec01Slide19-3.png' 
 style = '
   border:0;
   width:503.2272px;
   height:300.7273px;
' >
 
<aside class='notes'>
  What are Constraints? [pause]
  The design concept of constraining refers to restricting the kinds of user interaction that can take place at a given moment. 
  There are various ways that this can be achieved. For example, in a graphic user interface, deactivate certain menu options.

<section data-markdown style="text-align: left; line-height:95%; font-size:90%; "> 
<textarea data-template>
## Constraints

* **Logical** constraints
   - use reasoning to determine the alternatives
   - Example: user knows to scroll down and see the rest of the page

* **Cultural** Constraints
    - refers to the predefined conventions shared by a cultural group
    - Example: **scroll bar** you can hold down a mouse button and **drag** it downward is a cultural, learned convention

* **Physical** Constraints
    - refers to the ability to constrain the user's actions using a physical object
    - Example: not possible to move the cursor outside the screen
 
<aside class='notes'>
 There are three types of constraints [pause]
 The first are logical constraints [pause] use reasoning to determine the alternatives. For example, user knows to scroll down and see the rest of the page. [pause]
 The second are Cultural constraints [pause] and refer to predefined constraints shared by cultural group. For example  scroll bar. You can hold down a mouse button and drag it downward is a cultural and learned [pause]
 Finally physical constraints [pause] which refer to the ability to constrain the user's actions using a physical object. For example, not possible to move the cursor outside the screen.

<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
## Mapping
  * Describes the **relationship** between control elements and their effects in the world
  * Different types
    - Cultural and Physical
  * **Examples**: Volume, brightness, lift, buttons, ...
  
<img src='.\images\lec01Slide21-3.png' 
 style = '
   border:0;
   width:450px;
   height:auto;
' >
<br>
 
<aside class='notes'>
  What is Mapping? [pause]
  Mapping is about having a clear relationship between controls and the effect they have on the world. 
  You want this mapping to feel as natural as possible. 
  For examples the mapping of a volume, buttons or scroll bars.
</aside>
 
</textarea>
</section>
 
 
 
<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
# Consistency
  * Use **similar** operations and elements for similar tasks
    - Examples: short-cuts, control key plus first letter of command - Ctrl+O, Ctrl+S, Ctrl+C
  * Advantage: **Consistent interfaces** are easier to learn and use
  
<img src='.\images\lec01Slide22-3.png' 
 style = '
   border:0;
   width:auto;
   height:auto;
' >
 
<aside class='notes'>
  What is consistency? [pause]
 This refers to designing interfaces to have similar operations and use similar elements for achieving similar tasks.
 For example, use the same size buttons, consistent location, consistent colors for similar functions.

<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
## Feedback
  * Provide users with information about
    - The result of an action
    - Whether an **action** has been **executed**
    - The current state and which operations are possible
  * Rule of thumb: 0.01s, 0.1s, 1s, 10s
  * Use sound, highlighted, animation, ...

<aside class='notes'>
  What is feedback? [pause]
  Feedback involves sending back information about what action has been done and what has been accomplished.
  It provides the user with the information about the success or failure and what to do next.[pause]
  Use highlighted text, sound, animation for feedback. Read Donald Norman's rule of thumb for the useable duration of animation.

<section data-markdown> 
<textarea data-template>
# Cultural Assumption
  * Colors, symbols etc have different **meaning** in different cultures
  * Examples:
    - Meaning of color red 
	  - Western culture: danger, stop
	  - China: luck
	  - Russia: communism
	  - India: purity
	- Meaning of color white
	  - Europe and US: purity
	  - India, China and Japan: mourning
 
<aside class='notes'>
 What are Cultural Assumptions? [pause]
 Cultural assumptions by different cultures can be used as a design principle. 
 For example red color means luck in China. 
 However, it means danger or stop in the western culture.
 There are other examples you can read on the slide.
