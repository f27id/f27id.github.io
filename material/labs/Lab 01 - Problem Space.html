  - Create your group consisting of 2 students
  - Choose a problem space
  - Working on your research problem/design statement


# Some Project Ideas (mobile or GUI – i.e. an interface)

  - Interface to allow for better socializing in the pub
* Homes
  - For example, Interface that tracks your energy usage at the home and provides alerts, suggestions
* Health

* Education
  - For example, An interface to promote mathematics learning
* Mindfulness
  - For example, App will help you to become more present in your daily life.
* Tips: Look for a problem! Look at existing solutions!


# Exercise 1
* Create your group consisting of 2 students
* Choose a problem space
* What is your idea?


# Exercise 2

* Real
  - What is the current state of the system, how does it operate in reality today?
* Ideal
  - What could the desired system be? What are the Desirable  products and activities 
  - What is the possible solution, or the characteristics of a solution?


# Exercise 2A. Real v Ideal: A step towards formulating your project idea
* CONSIDER A REAL LIFE SITUATION WHERE THERE ARE FLAWS/PROBLEMS AND WHERE INTERFACES/MOBILE APPS CAN HELP CONSIDER EXISTING SOLUTIONS THAT ARE NOT IDEAL 
* DESCRIBE THE REAL AND IDEAL SITUATION/SCENARIO/CONTEXT BASED ON THE TABLES ABOVE
* DOMAINS: HEALTH, EDUCATION, WELL BEING, ENTERTAINMENT, ETC


# Problem Finding (in the real/current situation) Exercise 2B

* Look for the inefficiencies with a interface or activity 
* Who is having this problem? When do they have this problem? Why is it a problem?
When does it become a problem?
* Exercise 1B: Answer these questions briefly in your workbook 



# Exercise 3: Design Statement

* From your chosen project idea, move towards finalizing its design statement
* Design statement is a one line sentence that describes your project (and answers the who, what, where, why etc)
* Our goal is to design a “____ (what)” for “____ (who)” that provides a “___ (why)” and enhances “___(why)” while in a “____ (where)”
* Discuss your design statement with your tutor and clearly outline in your document (google drive, word doc)
