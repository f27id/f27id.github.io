# Lab - Design

Lab exercises to help you master the subject material for Introduction to Interaction Design (F27ID).

#Overview 
This lab provides activities to assist you in finalizing your design.

As you've progressed through the labs you should have been exploring and refining concepts for a specific design/idea.  

# Exercise 1

In this lab, you should be bringing together all the concepts we've discussed to formulate your final solution (from the initial problem space, prototyping, testing and evaluation through to the final product).

Develop a web-page (or other resource) to **pitch your final design** - (e.g., market your final solution) - including any sketches, testing, justifications and explanations about any innovations or originality (compared to existing solutions).

You need to be clear and concise about your design - also be critical and focused (e.g., why does it work? why it's better? what problems it overcomes? what validation/evidence have you developed? what existing studies have there been?)


# Exercise 2
In the lab, find a lab partner or a group of people to 'pitch' your solution to (imagine they're the stakeholders who are going to invest in your innovation).  Use your 'web-page' (or other resource) to present your design/findings.
