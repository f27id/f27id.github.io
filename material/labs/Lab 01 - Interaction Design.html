# Lab - Introduction 

Lab exercises to help you master the subject material and to complement the lecture material for Introduction to Interaction Design (F27ID).

## Overview

* Every week has a set of exercises/labs for you to work on 
* Maintain your answers in a workbook (online or word document) - to keep track of your learning/revision
* Each exercise will help you with your courseworks/revision 
* Do not worry if you are unable to finish the exercises, but attempt all the exercises


# Activities Planned for Lab 1

* Norman's design principles
* Culture and HCI
* Preparation for Project Assessments
* Please initiate your workbooks (track your progress and keep notes as you work through exercises)
* Remember to regularly do the task each week



# Norman’s Design Principles – following from Lecture 1

* Visibility - can I see it?
* Feedback - what is it doing now?
* Affordance - how do I use it?
* Mapping - where am I and where can I go?
* Constraint - why can't I do that?
* Consistency - I think I have seen this before?

(Note other aspects, such as Culture)

# Exercise 1

* Please think of 2 products/software interface/system you used/use/experienced that violates any of the mentioned Norman’s design principles
   - Kitchen, home, car, public transport, ATM, computer, tablet, mobile
   - Record your answers in your workbook
   - Describe which principles are violated and why giving clear explanations.


# Exercise 2

* Explore the website http://baddesigns.com/examples.html
* Choose 1 example from each of the categories and also provide justification for the choice,
   - Things, Displays, Controls, Signs
* For each example, reflect on which of Norman’s design principles does the product/system violate
* Record your notes in your workbook


# Exercise 3 

* Briefly review and discuss the importance of culture as a variable to consider when designing interfaces
* Read Don Norman’s article <a href="https://jnd.org/does_culture_matter_for_product_design/">Link</a>
* Briefly summarize his main view points as to why he thinks culture’s influence on HCI may not be as important as we think
* Do you agree with his views? Would his arguments (which are mainly intended for physical products) also apply to software/GUIs/etc?
