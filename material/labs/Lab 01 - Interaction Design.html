# Exercise 1

* Please think of 2 products/software interface/system you used/use/experienced that violates any of the mentioned Norman’s design principles
 - Kitchen, home, car, public transport, ATM, computer, tablet, mobile
 - Record your answers in your workbook
 - Describe which principles are violated and why giving clear explanations.


# Exercise 2

* Explore the website http://baddesigns.com/examples.html
* Choose 1 example from each of the categories and also provide justification for the choice,
 - Things, Displays, Controls, Signs
* For each example, reflect on which of Norman’s design principles does the product/system violate
* Record your notes in your workbook


# Exercise 3 

* We briefly discussed the importance of culture as a variable to consider when designing interfaces
* Read Don Norman’s article http://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/does_culture_matter_.html 
* Briefly summarize his main view points as to why he thinks culture’s influence on HCI may not be as important as we think
* Do you agree with his views? Would his arguments (which are mainly intended for physical products) also apply to software/GUIs/etc?
