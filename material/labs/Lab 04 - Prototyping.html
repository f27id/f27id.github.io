# Lab - Figma Exercises

Lab exercises to help you master the subject material and to complement the lecture material for Introduction to Interaction Design (F27ID).

#Overview 

Working with Figma software 



# Exercise 1
Goal: Use the events tab to control transition between Screens (based on a specific input criterion or otherwise).
Steps:
* 1.	Create a new prototype (web based) with two Screens: Screen 1 and Screen 2
* 2.	Include an input text field and button in Screen 1
* 3.	Include a label in Screen 2 with message: “Successful”
Main Aim: Screen 1 will transition to Screen 2 only when the text “abcd” is present in the text box
* 4.	Single click on the button and access the Events Tab towards the bottom of the Software window and click on Add Event (see image below)



# Further Tasks

As you'll learn, Figma is a flexible and powerful tool. Figma can also be used to simulate a database or records of data. As part of this week’s lab, you should attempt to try and develop a number of small test prototypes (familiarise yourself with the Figma interface/functionality).

## To get you started, try working through the kickstarter lessons from **Figma**
