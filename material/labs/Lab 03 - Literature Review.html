# Lab - Literature Review

Lab exercises to help you master the subject material and to complement the lecture material for Introduction to Interaction Design (F27ID).


# Overview - Project Ideas (Final Coursework)

As you work through the course exercises and tasks, you should be thinking about project ideas for the final coursework.
For example, some project ideas (mobile or GUI – i.e. an interface) include:

* Interface to allow for better socializing in the pub
* Interface that tracks your energy usage at the home and provides alerts, suggestions
* Interface that tracks the medicine intake of patients at home
* Mobile app that encourages young obese children to play outdoors
* Design an easy to use online tool for home furniture shopping
* An intelligent photo holder interface that connects parents and children who are distant
* Tips: Look for a problem! Look at existing solutions!



# Activities (Research)

Your goal for today's lab is to find three relevant research articles from the HCI domain related to a project of your choosing
	- These articles will support your ideas and help you state problems you're trying to solve - which is important!  Hence, the choice of keywords is critical.
	- Again you will not find articles which simply state the same idea

* Review the lecture slides on what makes a credible article, for example:
    * Wikipedia and generally most online websites are not academic, while
    * Academic conference papers and journal articles (usually peer reviewed) are reliable sources


# What is a credible source?

* Authority: what are the authors credentials? What type of site? 
* Is the content peer reviewed? 
* Accuracy: are the facts verifiable? References included? 
* Objectivity: is it fact, opinion or propaganda? 
* is it up-to-date? Is the date indicated?
* Who else cites the work? How many times?


# How can I find/retrieve literature?

* Google Scholar <a href='https://scholar.google.com'>[link]</a>
    - keywords important, use advanced scholar
    - Google Scholar tells you how many times the work has been cited elsewhere

# Advanced Google Scholar

* Google Scholar
    - keywords important, use advanced scholar
    - Google Scholar tells you how many times the work has been cited elsewhere


# Exercise 1 

* Use Google Scholar to locate three to seven articles that are relevant to a project of your choosing (focus on themes, articles which describe the problem, general ideas, etc – you will not find articles that discuss your exact solution)
* You should be able to directly access PDF’s, otherwise login to the Library

Examples of HCI venues/conferences
* Premier HCI conference: CHI (conference on Human factors in computing systems)
* INTERACT, British HCI, NordiCHI, Mobile HCI (for mobile computing)
* IDC (Interaction design for children)
* HRI (Human Robot Interaction conference), ASSETS (Designing for the disabled, accessibility)

Examples of HCI Journals
* ACM Interactions
* ACM Transactions on HCI
* Journal of Human Computer Studies
* Top Venues in HCI: https://scholar.google.es/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_humancomputerinteraction


# Exercise 2

* Skim through the abstracts and content of the identified papers and try to extract the main theme or take home message of the articles
* Attempt to group them under different categories (which will be their themes) by their similarities and differences - We are now in the first stages of writing a literature review

# Exercise 3 

* Benchmarking your Proposed Design
* How do you benchmark your app against existing commercial apps. 
* Using Google Play, iTunes or Microsoft store identify at least one application that is relevant to your proposed idea. Explore this application. Clearly identify how you intend to build upon this app (what key features are missing that you intend to add in your design?)
* Examine the UI design for the app. Provide at least three shortcomings of the UI design by relating it back to Norman design principles
